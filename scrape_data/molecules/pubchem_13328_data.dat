   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * METHYL- & ETHYLMERCURY CHLORIDE HAVE A HIGH SOLUBILITY IN SOLVENTS
       & LIPIDS; SHORT-CHAIN ALKYLMERCURIC COMPOUNDS FORM SALTS WITH
       HALOGENS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY VOLATILE AT ROOM TEMP; SATURATION CONCN
       OF METHYLMERCURY CHLORIDE AT 20 DEG C IS 90000 MG MERCURY/CU M;
       OTHER SALTS, SUCH AS HYDROXIDE & NITRATE OF METHYLMERCURY ARE LESS
       VOLATILE /METHYLMERCURY COMPOUNDS/
