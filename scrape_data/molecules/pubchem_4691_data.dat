   Color/Form
        SELENIUM EXISTS IN SEVERAL ALLOTROPIC FORMS. 3 ARE GENERALLY
   RECOGNIZED ... SELENIUM CAN BE PREPD WITH EITHER AMORPHOUS OR
   CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. ... AMORPHOUS IS EITHER RED, IN POWDER FORM OR
   BLACK, IN VITREOUS FORM. CRYSTALLINE MONOCLINIC PRISM IS DEEP RED;
   CRYSTALLINE HEXAGONAL FORM, THE MOST STABLE VARIETY, IS A METALLIC
   GRAY.

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * COMBINES DIRECTLY WITH HYDROGEN, WITH THE HALOGENS (EXCLUDING
       IODINE); OXIDIZED TO SELENIOUS ACID BY NITRIC ACID, TO SELENIC ACID
       BY SULFURIC ACID; REDUCES HOT AQUEOUS SOLN OF SILVER AND GOLD SALTS
       WITH FORMATION OF SILVER SELENIDE AND METALLIC GOLD, RESPECTIVELY
     * EXHIBITS BOTH PHOTOVOLTAIC ACTION, WHERE LIGHT IS CONVERTED
       DIRECTLY TO ELECTRICITY; EXHIBITS PHOTOCONDUCTIVE ACTION, WHERE
       ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE DECREASES WITH INCREASED ILLUMINATION
     * Vitreous, Black selenium; dark red-brown to bluish-black solid;
       density = 4.28; softens at 50 to 60 deg C and becomes elastic at 70
       deg C. Red amorphous form; density = 4.26. When freshly
       precipitated, reacts with water at 50 deg C forming selenious acid
       and hydrogen. Soluble in carbon disulfide, methylene iodide,
       benzene and quinoline /amorphous forms/.
     * Two monoclinic forms; dark red, transparent crystals. Melting point
       below 200 deg C. Density (alpha-form) 4.46. Both forms are
       metastable and change into gray form on heating /Crystalline or red
       selenium/.
     * Crystalline selenium is a p-type semiconductor; forms binary alloys
       with silver, copper, zinc, lead, etc.
     * Selenium reacts with active metals and gains electrons to form
       ionic compounds containing the selenide ion, Se 2-, selenium forms
       covalent compounds with most other substances.
     * LIQUID IS A BROWNISH RED
     * Lustrous gray to black hexagonal crystals; insol in alcohol; very
       slightly sol in carbon disulfide (2 mg/100 ml); sol in ether;
       conducts electricity & rectifies alternating current; conductivity
       increases up to 1000 times on exposure to light; density 4.81 @ 20
       deg C/4 deg C; melting point 217 deg C; Mohs' hardness: 2.0; Latent
       heat of fusion 16.4 cal/g; Latent heat of vaporization 20.6
       kcal/mol; Linear coefficient of thermal expansion per degree C=
       37X10-6; Specific heat (28 deg C): 0.084 cal/g/deg C; Surface
       tension (217 deg C): 92.5 dynes/cm; Thermal conductivity (25 deg
       C): 0.0007-0.00183 cal/(cm)(deg C)/sec. /Gray selenium/
     * MELTING POINT: TRANSITION POINT TO HEXAGONAL: 60-80 DEG C
       /AMORPHOUS SELENIUM/
     * SOL IN CHLOROFORM /GRAY SELENIUM/
     * SOL IN CARBON DISULFIDE: 0.1 G/100 CC @ 46.6 DEG C /RED SELENIUM/
