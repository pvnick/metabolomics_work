   Corrosivity

     * Iron, steel, nickel, copper-nickel alloys, & inconel
       nickel-chromium-iron are satisfactory for dry or hot sulfur
       dioxide, but they are readily corroded below the dew point or by
       wet sulfur dioxide gas. Liquid sulfur dioxide produces serious
       corrosion of iron, brass, and copper at about 0.2 wt% or higher
       moisture content.
     * Liquid sulfur dioxide will attack some forms of plastic, rubber, &
       coatings
     * Corrodes aluminum

   Solubilities

     * Soluble in water, ethanol, diethyl ether, chloroform
     * In water: 17.7% at 0 deg C; 11.9% at 15 deg C; 8.5% at 25 deg C;
       6.4% at 35 deg C. In alcohol: 25%. In methanol: 32%. Also soluble
       in chloroform or ether.
     * The liquid is only slightly miscible with water. The gas is soluble
       to the extent of 36 v/v water at 20 deg C, but it is very soluble
       (several hundred v/v of solvent) in a number of organic solvents,
       eg, acetone, other ketones, and formic acid. Sulfur dioxide is less
       soluble in nonpolar solvents.
