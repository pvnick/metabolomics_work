   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Malleable
     * Heat capacity: 6.22 cal/mole-deg at 25 deg C & constant pressure;
       readily cut with knife
     * Tarnishes in moist air.
     * Cadmium becomes brittle at 80 deg C.
     * Eight stable isotopes of cadmium (Cd) are known in nature with
       conventional abundances as follows: (106)Cd: 1.21%; (108)Cd: 0.88%;
       (110)Cd: 12.39%; (111)Cd: 12.75%; (112)Cd: 24.07%, (113)Cd: 12.26%;
       (114)Cd: 28.86%; (116)Cd: 7.58%.
     * The electrical conductivity of cadmium is less than that of silver
       or copper, but greater than that of iron.
     * Cadmium (Cd) has two radioisotopes: (109)Cd and (115)Cd.
     * Slowly oxidized by moist air to form CdO. Electrode potential (aq)
       Cd/Cd2+ 0.4025 V. Reacts readily with dil HNO3; reacts slowly with
       hot HCl; does not react with alkalies. Other reactions similar to
       those of zinc. Solns of cadmium salts and H2S or Na2S yield a
       yellow ppt insol in excess Na2S.
     * Heat of fusion 6.19 kJ/mol
