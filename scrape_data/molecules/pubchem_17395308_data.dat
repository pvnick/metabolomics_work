   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * The stability of methoprene in water was studied. An emulsifiable
       concentrate persisted for 134 days at 4.5C and for 49 days at 20C
       in both fresh and salt water. The slow release flowable liquid
       degraded at 20C at about the same rate as did the E.C. formulation
       at 4.5C.
     * Stable in water, organic solvents, and in the presence of aqueous
       acids and alkalis.
