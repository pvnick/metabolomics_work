   Solubilities

     * Moderately soluble in alcohol; stable in concentrated aqueous
       solution but decomposes in dilute aqueous solutions
     * In acetone, ethanol, kerosene, xylene < 5 g/L. Practically
       insoluble in most other organic solvents.
     * In water, 7.22X10+5 mg/L at 20 deg C [Shiu WY et al; Rev Environ

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Crystals; anhydrous at 130 deg C; moderately sol in alcohol; 72.2
       g/100 mL water at 20 deg C; moderately sol in alcohol; sparingly
       sol in other solvents; unpleasant odor, similar to that of
       disulfide. /Sodium methyldithiocarbamate dihydrate/
     * Colorless crystals. /Dihydrate/
     * IN DIL AQ SOLN, AT PH 9.5, VAPAM DECOMPOSES TO METHYL
       ISOTHIOCYANATE AND SULFUR; UNDER ACID CONDITIONS, CARBON DISULFIDE,
       HYDROGEN SULFIDE, N,N'-DIMETHYLTHIURAM DISULFIDE, METHYLAMINE,
       METHYL ISOTHIOCYANATE ARE FORMED.
     * A soil fungicide, nematocide, & herbicide reputed to act by
       decomposition in moist soil to methyl isothiocyanate. If true, this
       may be a unique property of metham, as opposed to many closely
       related chemicals used for much of the same purposes, eg, ferbam,
       nabam, ziram, zineb, & maneb.
