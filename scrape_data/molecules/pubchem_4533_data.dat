   Corrosivity

     * The high mobility and tendency to dispersion exhibited by mercury,
       and the ease with which it forms alloys (amalga) with many
       laboratory and electrical contact metals, can cause severe
       corrosion problems in laboratories.
     * Special precautions: Mercury can attack copper and copper alloy
       materials.

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Ductile malleable mass which may be cut with a knife; atomic number
       80; valences 1 and 2; group 2B element of periodic table; natural
       isotopes 202 (29.80%), 200 (23.13%), 199 (16.84%), 201 (13.22%),
       198 (10.02%), 204 (6.85%) and 196 (0.146%); electrical resistivity
       95.76 microohm cm at 20 deg C; forms alloys with most metals except
       iron and combines with sulfur at ordinary temp; reacts with HNO3,
       hot concn H2SO4, and ammonia solutions to form Hg2NOH (Millon's
       base); std electrode reduction potential: eo (aq) Hg/Hg2+ equals
       -0.854 volts; eo (aq) 2 Hg/2Hg2+ equals -0.789 volts
     * Heat capacity at constant pressure: 6.687 cal/mole at 25 deg C
     * FORMS CMPD WITH ORG RADICALS, NORMALLY LINKING COVALENTLY TO CARBON
       ATOM
     * SATURATED ATMOSPHERE AT 24 DEG C CONTAINS APPROX 18 MG/CU M; THE
       VAPOR EXISTS IN A MONOATOMIC STATE
     * Heat of fusion: 2.7 cal/g
     * Mercury salts, when heated with Na2CO3, yield metallic Hg and are
       reduced to metal by H2O2 in the presence of alkali hydroxide. Cu,
       Fe, Zn and many other metals precipitate metallic Hg from neutral
       or slightly acid soln of mercury salts.
