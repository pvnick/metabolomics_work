   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * MP: Decomposes at 278-282 deg C (darkens at about 240 deg C)
     * Visible or ultraviolet radiation of alkaline solutions causes the
       formation of lumiflavine ... whereas irradiation of acid or neutral
       solutions gives rise to the production of lumichrome ... togther
       with varying amounts of lumiflavine
     * Sensitive to alkalies; stable to mineral acids in the dark
     * In solution, riboflavin has an intense greenish-yellow flourescence
     * In alkaline solution it is readily soluble but quite unstable to
       heat and to light forming lumiflavin, a fluorescent degradation
       product. Riboflavin is nore stable to heat in acid solution,
       particularly from pH 1.0 to 6.5 but upon irradiation forms
       lumichrome. Riboflavin is readily adsorbed from acid or neutral
       solution on such agents as frankonite, fuller's earth, and certain
       zeolites, and eluted with acetone or pyridine solutions.
     * Riboflavin is rapidly reduced by hydrosulfite, or by hydrogen in
       the presence of zinc in acid solution.
     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 2.47X10-10 cu
       cm/molec-sec at 25 deg C (est)
