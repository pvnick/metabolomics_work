   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * At acid pH slowly releases nitrous acid to give
       N-methyl-N'-nitroguanidine; it is converted by concentrated aqueous
       alkali hydroxide to diazomethane; reactions with several
       nucleophiles are known, especially with amines
     * Reacts with aq KOH to form diazomethane: a.f. McKay, J Am Chem Soc
       70, 1974 (1948); reacts at acid pH to give methylnitroguanidine.
     * Pure N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine is sensitive to light,
       changing to orange and green colors.
     * Half-life at pH 8 is about 200 hours; at pH 7 (phosphate buffer)
       and 37 deg C the half-life is 170 hours.
