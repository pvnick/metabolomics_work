   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Weight 10.34 lb/gal
     * The use of global and substituent physicochemical structure
       descriptors for quantitative structure-property relationship
       studies has been evaluated through direct and autocorrelated
       applications. Partial least squares analysis has been used to
       predict the partition coefficient for octanol/water, log P, for
       chlorinated alkylbenzenes. This investigation revealed that various
       of the physicochemical parameters considered were highly correlated
       with the partition coefficient and that partial least square models
       based on global, direct or autocorrelated substituent parameters
       all seem to be adequate for prediction of log P, as compared to
       results obtained experimentally or by means of standard substituent
       calculation schemes. However, the use of autocorrelation vectors of
       connectivity, steric and electronic effects may be preferably due
       to a high degree of explanation of the molecular descriptor
       variance.
