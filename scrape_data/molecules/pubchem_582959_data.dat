     * Caustic soda reacts with all the mineral acids to form the
       corresponding salts. It also reacts with weak-acid gases, such as
       hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide. Caustic soda
       reacts with amphoteric metals (Al, Zn, Sn) and their oxides to form
       complex anions such as AlO2(-), ZnO2(-2), SNO2(-2), and H2 (or H2O
       with oxides). All organic acids also react with sodium hydroxide to
       form soluble salts. Another common reaction of caustic soda is
       dehydrochlorination.
