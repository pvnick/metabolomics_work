   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * SOLN OF DIAZOMETHANE & ETHER OR DIOXANE DECOMP ONLY SLOWLY @ LOW
       TEMP; DECOMP MORE RAPID IF ALCOHOL OR WATER PRESENT
     * COPPER POWDER CAUSES ACTIVE DECOMP WITH EVOLUTION OF NITROGEN &
       FORMATION OF INSOL WHITE FLAKES OF POLYMETHYLENE (CH2)
     * UNDILUTED LIQ & CONCN SOLN MAY EXPLODE VIOLENTLY, ESP IF IMPURITIES
       ARE PRESENT. GASEOUS DIAZOMETHANE MAY EXPLODE ON HEATING TO 100 DEG
       C OR ON ROUGH GLASS SURFACES. GROUND GLASS APPARATUS & GLASS
       STIRRERS WITH GLASS SLEEVE BEARINGS WHERE GRINDING MAY OCCUR,
       SHOULD NOT BE USED. ALKALI METALS ALSO PRODUCE EXPLOSIONS ...
     * ... MAY EXPLODE VIOLENTLY ON HEATING OR IN CONTACT WITH ROUGH
       SURFACES. IN ETHER OR BENZENE, IN WHICH DIAZOMETHANE IS SOL, THE
       DANGER OF EXPLOSION IS MUCH DECREASED.
