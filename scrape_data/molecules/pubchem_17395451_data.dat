     * Oxygen indexes (Minimum percentage of oxygen in an oxygen-nitrogen
       atm required to sustain combustion after ignition) for the
       chlorotoluene isomers are ... para 19.1. /Flame retardants/
     * At moderate temp and pressures the monochlorotoluenes are stable to
       the action of steam, alkalies, amines, and hydrochloric and
       phosphoric acids. Reactions can be divided into three classes:
       reactions of the aromatic ring; reactions of the methyl group; and
       reactions involving the chlorine substituent.
     * Dielectric constant 6.20 @ 20 deg C
     * Nitration of p-chlorotoluene produces a mixture of 66%
       4-chloro-2-nitrotoluene and 34% 4-chloro-3-nitrotoluene. ...
       Sulfonation of p-chlorotoluene with 20% oleum gives the
       2-sulfonated product in 68% yield. ... p-Chlorophenylacetonitrile
       is produced in high yield from the reaction of p-chlorotoluene and
       cyanogen chloride at 650-700 deg C.
     * Heat of fusion = 102.46 J/g; Heat capacity = 0.304 J/g-K
     * A theoretical relation has been established between structure and
       activity of organic chemicals based on acute toxicity mechanism to
       aquatic organisms. The theory was tested by examining correlation
       equations between LC50 and EC50 of six aquatic organisms. The
       equations are then used to estimate LC50 values of organic
       chemicals. The predicted LC50 values are close to observed LC50
       values.
     * Quantitative structure-activity relationship estimates of toxicity
       of narcotic chemicals for 19 species of bacteria, algae, fungi,
       protozoans, coelenterates, rotifers, molluscs, crustaceans,
       insects, fish, and amphibians were used to predict no-effect levels
       at the ecosystem level by means of recently developed extrapolation
       methods. Equilibrium partitioning theory was used to derive no
       effect levels for aquatic sediments and internal toxicant
       concentrations for aquatic organisms. A simple table is given from
       which no effect levels for narcotic chemicals for water, sediment,
       and residues in biota can be predicted on the basis of only the
       octanol/water partition coefficient and molecular weight. The
       method may be applied to setting quality criteria for the aquatic
       environment and to ecotoxicological interpretation of
       (bio)monitoring data. Calculations were carried out for 102
       narcotic compounds.
