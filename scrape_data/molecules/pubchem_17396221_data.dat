   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * The utility of triorganotin halides and their application as
       starting materials for most other triorganotin compounds results
       from the ease of nucleophic displacement. /Triorganotin halides/
     * Triorganic tin compounds of strong acids are genrally quite stable
       to hydrolysis under neutral conditions. Under basic conditions, the
       hydroxide or bisoxide forms. Strong acids, halogens, and other
       electrophiles can cause cleavage of the tin-carbon bondds with the
       formation of diorganotins. /Triorganotins/
