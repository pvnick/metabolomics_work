   Color/Form

     * ORTHORHOMBIC, ELONGATED, SIX-SIDED TABLETS FROM DIMETHYL PHTHALATE
     * Crystallizes from a variety of solvents as somewhat unstable,
       colorless, orthorhombic, deliquescent crystals.
     * Colorless crystals
     * Cyanamide forms colorless, orthorhombic crystals or long
       transparent needles (from water), large platelike crystals when
       allowed to crystallize spontaneously from water, and crystals from
       dimethyl phthalate solution.

   Spectral Properties

     * INDEX OF REFRACTION: 1.4418 @ 48 DEG C/D
     * IR: 7572 (Documentation of Molecular Spectroscopy Collection)
     * UV: 5-2 (Organic Electronic Spectral Data, Phillips et al, John
       Wiley & Sons, New York)
     * The IR spectrum of cyanamide exhibits an intense, poorly resolved
       doublet at 2225-2260 /cm. The UV spectrum shows only weak
       absorption below 230 nm, with no maximum observable above 208 nm.

       temperatures, particularly above the melting point, decomposition
       to dicyandiamide and urea becomes rapid.
