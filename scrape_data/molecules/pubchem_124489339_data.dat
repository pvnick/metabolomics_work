   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Miscible with other emulsifiable organophosphate insecticides.
     * Good stability when in non-polar solvents, more unstable in the
       pure state. Hydrolyzed more rapidly in alkaline media than in
       acidic media.
     * Easily hydrolyzed in aqueous solution at 25 deg C; 50% loss in 25
       days at pH 3, 27 days at pH 6 and 17 days at pH 9.
