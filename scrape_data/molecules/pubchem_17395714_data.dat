   Corrosivity
        At ambient temperature, a 25% solution of chloroxylenol in
   isopropanol is not corrosive to stainless steel or aluminum. Brass is
   slightly affected as is mild steel. Mild steel is slightly affected by
   isopropanol alone.

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Chloroxylenol is stable when exposed to sunlight and humidity from
       ambient storage over 24 hours. It is also stable at elevated
       temperatures (54 deg C). Choroxylenol is hydrolytically stable.
