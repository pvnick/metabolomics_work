   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Aqueous solutions of Fenton's reagent iron (2+)+ hydrogen peroxide
       have been used to affect the total decomposition of the
       chlorophenols: 2-chlorophenol, 3-chlorophenol, 4-chlorophenol,
       3,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,5-trichorophenol. The mineralization of
       these chlorinated aromatic substrates to carbon dioxide and free
       chloride has been studied as a function of iron (2+)+ hydrogen
       peroxide and perchloric acid. Increasing the concentration of iron
       (2+)+ hydrogen peroxide enhances the decomposition process, while
       an increase in the concentration of perchloric acid, inhibits the
       reaction. The presence of iron (3+) alone without any iron (2+)
       with hydrogen peroxide has no effect on the degradation of the
       chlorophenols. In all cases, the stoichiometric quantity of free
       chloride was obtained at the completion of the decomposition
       reaction; but the rates of disappearance of the chlorophenol and of
       the formation of the chloride are not similar.

     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 6.99X10-12 cu
