   Corrosivity
        The rates of corrosion of iron and steel in water are a function
   of the specific mineral quality as well as the alkalinity and pH
   values. Sodium sulfate ... is a strong contributor to the rate of
   corrosion. For example, in water with 400 mg/l of alkalinity (as CaCO3)
   at pH 7, the corrosion rate will be zero at 200 mg/l of Na2SO4, but
   when the concentration of sodium sulfate is 400 mg/l, the corrosion
   rate will be about 100 mg per square cm per day.
