   Color/Form

     * Hard grey metal
     * Steel grey, lustrous, hard, brittle metal
     * Alpha is body centered cubic; beta is cubic; delta is body centered
       cubic.

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * One stable isotope: 55; exists in 4 allotropic forms: alpha form:
       body-centered cubic, stable below approx. 710 deg C, density (at 20
       deg C): 7.47; beta form: cubic, stable in the range 710-1079 deg C,
       density (at 20 deg C): 7.26; gamma form or electrolytic manganese:
       face-centered cubic, stable in the range 1079-1143 deg C, density
       (at 1100 deg C): 6.37; delta form: body-centered cubic, stable in
       the range 1143 deg C to melting point, density (at 1143 deg C):
       6.28; gamma manganese when stabilized at room temperature is
       face-centered tetragonal, density (at 20 deg C): 7.21; melting
       point: 1244 deg C; boiling point: 2095 deg C
     * Superficially oxidized on exposure to air. Burns with an intense
       white light when heated in air. Decomposes in water slowly in the
       cold, rapidly on heating; pure electrolytic manganese is not
       attacked by steam. Reacts with dilute mineral acids with evolution
       of hydrogen and formation of divalent manganous salts. Reacts with
       aqueous solns of sodium or potassium bicarbonate. When heated in
       nitrogen above 2000 deg C burns to form a nitride. Converted by
       fluorine into the di- and trifluoride, by chlorine into the
       dichloride. In form of powder reduces most metallic oxides on
       heating. On heating, reacts directly with carbon, phosphorous,
       antimony or arsenic.
     * Density: alpha, 7.47 at 20 deg C; beta, 7.26 at 20 deg C; gamma,
       6.37 at 1100 deg C; delta, 6.28 at 1143 deg C
     * When stabilized at room temp, gamma has mp of 1244 deg C and bp of
       2095 deg C
     * Specific heat 0.115 cal/g/deg C; latent heat of fusion 3.5
       kcal/g-atom
     * COLORS GLASS AN AMETHYST COLOR, & IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLOR OF TRUE
       AMETHYST
     * Alpha is stable below approx 710 deg C; beta is stable between
       710-1079 deg C; gamma is stable between 1079-1143 deg C; delta is
       stable between 1143 deg C and its melting point.
     * GAMMA FORM CHANGES TO ALPHA AT ORDINARY TEMP
     * Superficially oxidized on exposure to air. Burns with an intense
       white light when heated in air. Decomposes in water slowly in the
       cold, rapidly on heating; pure electrolytic manganese is not
       attacked by steam. Reacts with dilute mineral acids with evolution
       of hydrogen and formation of divalent manganous salts. Reacts with
       aqueous solns of sodium or potassium bicarbonate. When heated in
       nitrogen above 2000 deg C burns to form a nitride. Converted by
       fluorine into the di- and trifluoride, by chlorine into the
       dichloride. In form of powder reduces most metallic oxides on
       heating. On heating, reacts directly with carbon, phosphorous,
       antimony or arsenic.
     * Vapor pressure: 5.55X10-7 Pa at 800 K; 0.00221 at 1000 K; 0.524 Pa
       at 1200 K; 24.9 Pa at 1400 deg C /Calculated/
     * Standard enthalpy of fusion: 12.91 kJ/mol

     * The alpha and beta forms are brittle; the ductile gamma form is
       unstable and quickly reverses to the alpha form unless kept at low
       temperature
     * There are 4 allotropic forms of which the alpha form is the most
       important
     * Molar heat capacity: 26.32 J/mol K at 25 deg C, 100 kPa (760 mm Hg)
     * Reduction potential (Acidic or neutral media): +1.5 V (MnO4-/Mn2+);
       +1.3 V (Mn3+/Mn2+); -1.18 V(Mn2+/Mn)
