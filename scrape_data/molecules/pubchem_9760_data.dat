   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Dibenzodioxins occur as 75 different isomers. There are 22 possible
       TCDD isomers.
     * Octanol/Water partition coefficient expressed as LogP: 7.05 /from
       table/
     * /Toxic equivalency factors (TEF), indicate the toxicity of a
       compound relative to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, which
       itself has been assigned a TEF of 1.0. Concentration data for
       polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins are frequently reported in units
       of toxic equivalency which are equal to the measured concentration
       of substance multiplied by its TEF./ TheTEF for
       2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is 1.0.
