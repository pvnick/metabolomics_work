   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * AQUEOUS SOLN IS ALKALINE TO LITMUS & PHENOLPHTHALEIN
     * Thin, irregular plate-like crystals from acetone, mp 94-102 deg C.
       Also reported as 90-92 deg C. Freely sol in water; sol in ethanol,
       methanol, acetone. Insol in ether, benzene. The aq soln is alkaline
       to litmus and phenolphthalein and slowly dec. (pH of 10% aq soln is
       11.6 at room temp). The addition of an acid to the aq soln produces
       a white turbidity due to the liberation of carbon disulfide. UV max
       (ethanol): 257, 290 nm (epsilon 1200, 1300) /Trihydrate/
     * Greenish-yellow liquid with a characteristic smell comprising a 23%
       solution in water
