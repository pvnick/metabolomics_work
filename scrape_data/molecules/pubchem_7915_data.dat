   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Boiling point: -18.9 deg C at 2 atm; 7.3 deg C at 5 atm; 32.0 at 10
       atm; 127.5 deg C at 60 atm; decomposed by light; specific heat:
       0.0545 cal/ g deg C at 25 deg C; forms an azeotrope with water
       /Hydrogen iodide/
     * A solution of hydrogen iodide in water; marketed in various
       concentrations; 57% HI density: 1.7; 47% HI, density: 1.5; 10% HI,
       density: 1.1; colorless when freshly made, but rapidly turns
       yellowish or brown on exposure to light and air; miscible with
       water and alcohol; dissolves iodine; the azeotrope (56.9% HI) boils
       at 127 deg C; density: 1.70; strong, corrosive acid; attacks
       natural rubber; 0.10 molar solution: pH 1.0 /Hydriodic acid/
     * SPECIFIC GRAVITY: 2.85 AT -4.7 DEG C (LIQUID)
     * Heat of fusion= 0.686
     * Heat of vaporization: 17.36 kJ/mol @ 25 deg C /Hydrogen iodide gas/
     * Decomposes in light. Unstable at room temperatures and above,
       slowly decomposing to hydrogen and iodine. /Hydrogen iodide gas/
     * Dissolves metals, oxides, carbonates, and salts of the other weak,
       mono-oxidizing acids, causing the formation of iodides.
     * Henry's Law constant = 2.5X10+9 mol/L atm (4.0X10-13 atm-cu m/mol)
