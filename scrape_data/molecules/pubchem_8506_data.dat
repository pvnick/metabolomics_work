   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Heat of fusion: 21 kJ/mol
     * Latent heat of fusion: approx 3.5 kcal/mol; heat capacity (25 deg
       C): 5.58 cal/mol deg. Takes a high polish; hard as corundum and
       less fusible than platinum. Valences 1-6.
     * UNDER STRONGLY OXIDIZING CONDITIONS, MAY BE CONVERTED TO HEXAVALENT
       STATE & OCCUR AS CHROMATE ANIONS
     * ELECTRONEGATIVITY (PAULING SCALE): 1.6; ORBITAL ELECTRONS:
       (AR)3D5-4S1; ABUNDANCE (% OF EARTH'S CRUST): 2X10-2
     * Chromium is a mixture of four stable isotopes with mass numbers 50
       (4.31%), 52 (83.76%), 53 (9.55%) and 54 (2.38%). Thermal neutron
       capture cross sections are 17, 0.8, 18 and 0.38, respectively.
     * Five radioistopes are known, two others (mass numbers 46 & 47) have
       been reported.
     * Linear coefficient of thermal expansion at 20 deg C= 6.2X10-6.
       Thermal conductivity at 20 deg C, W(mK)= 91. Total emissivity at
       100 deg C, nonoxidizing atm= 0.08. Elastic modulus, GPa= 250.
       Compressibility at 10-60 TPa= 70X10-3.
     * Vapor pressure: 1 Pa @ 1383 deg C (sublimes)
     * Chromium forms a number of compounds in various oxidation states.
       Those of 2+ (chromous), 3+ (chromic) and 6+ (chromates) are the
       most important /Chromium, alloys and cmpd/
