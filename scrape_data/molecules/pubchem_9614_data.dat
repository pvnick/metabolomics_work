   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Reduces friction drag of water on metals
     * Water solutions are tasteless, odorless, of a pale, translucent
       gray color, and neutral; has 5 to 8 times the thickening power of
       starch; water solutions may be converted to a gel by small amt of
       borax; stable to heat
     * THE MANNOSE-GALACTOSE RATIO IS ABOUT 2:1 AND MOLECULAR WT APPROX
       220,000-250,000; MAX VISCOSITY IS REACHED IN APPROX 2 HR IN COLD
       WATER; THE RATE OF HYDRATION AND VISCOSITY ARE INCREASED @ HIGHER
       TEMPERATURES; SOLUTIONS ARE SLIGHTLY CLOUDY DUE TO PRESENCE OF A
       SMALL AMT OF INSOL FIBER AND CELLULOSE; SOLUTIONS ARE THIXOTROPIC
       AND VISCOSITY IS RELATIVELY UNAFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF
       ELECTROLYTES; COMPATIBLE WITH STARCH, GELATIN AND OTHER WATER SOL
       GUMS; GUAR IS COMPOSED OF A STRAIGHT CHAIN OF D-MANNOSE WITH A
       D-GALACTOSE SIDE CHAIN AT APPROX EVERY MANNOSE UNIT.
     * SUGAR UNITS: D-MANNOSE BETA-(1 TO 4), D-GALACTOSE-(1 TO 6) BRANCHES
