     * Fuming nitric acid is concentrated nitric acid that contains
       dissolved nitrogen dioxide. The density and vapor pressure of such
       solutions increase with the percentage of nitrogen dioxide present.
       Acid containing calculated 45 wt % nitrogen dioxide and 55% nitric
       acid has a vapor pressure of 101 kPa (760 mm Hg) at 25 deg C and a
       density of 1.64 g/cu m.
     * Heat of formation at 25 deg C: -173.35 kJ/mol
     * Free energy of formation at 25 deg C: -79.97 kJ/mol
     * Entropy at 25 deg C: 155.71 kJ/(mol)(k)
     * Heat of fusion: 10.48 kJ/mol
     * Two hydrates may be crystallized from acid solutions, ie, a nitric
       acid monohydrate, corresponding to 77.77 wt % acid, and a nitric
       acid trihydrate corresponding to 53.83 wt % acid. With local maxima
       at the freezing points of the crystal forms, the freezing point
       curve for nitric acid solutions is irregular. Local minima occur at
       32, 71, and 91 wt % acid.
     * Weigh: 10.4 lb/gal, nitric acid, 40% or less; 12.6 lb/gal, nitric
       acid, over 40%; 12.5 lb/gal, nitric acid, fuming.
     * Molar enthalpy of fusion: 10.50 kJ/mol
