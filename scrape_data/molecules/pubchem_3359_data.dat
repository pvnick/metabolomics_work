   Color/Form

     * Colorless, oily liquid
     * Clear, colorless, oily liquid
     * Dense, oily liquid; colorless to dark brown depending on purity
     * Colorless to dark brown, oily liquid (Note: Pure compound is a
       solid below 51 degrees F. Often used in an aqueous solution).

   Corrosivity

     * Very corrosive
     * CONCENTRATED ACID IS NON-CORROSIVE TO LEAD & MILD STEEL BUT DIL
       ACID ATTACKS MOST METALS.
     * Corrosion data for ASTM Grade 2 Titanium: Boiling sulfuric acid at
       a concentration of 1% by weight had a corrosion rate of 2.5 mm/yr.
     * Attacks and corrodes many metals releasing hydrogen.
     * Resistance of alloys to concentrated sulfuric acid corrosion
       increases with increasing chromium, molybdenum, and silicon
       content. The corrosiveness of sulfuric acid solutions is highly
       dependent on concentration, temperature, acid velocity, and acid
       impurities.

   Solubilities

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Heat of formation: -909.3 kJ/mol at 25 deg C; Gibbs energy of
       formation: -744.5 kJ/mol at 25 deg C; entropy: 20.1 J/mol-K at 25
       deg C; heat capacity: -293.0 J/mol-K at 25 deg C /Sulfuric acid
       aqueous solution/
     * Heat of fusion: 10.71 kJ/mol
     * Has a great affinity for water, abstracting it from the air and
       also from many organic substances; hence it chars sugar, wood, etc.
     * Decomposes at 340 deg C into sulfur trioxide and water
     * Very reactive, dissolves most metals; concentrated acid oxidizes,
       dehydrates, or sulfonates most organic compounds, often causes
       charring
     * Vapor pressure: 1 mm Hg at 145.8 deg C
     * Surface tension: in contact with air or vapor st 20 deg C= 55.1
       dynes/cm /98.5% Sulfuric acid/
     * DECOMP IN ALCOHOL
     * DECOMP SALTS OF OTHER ACIDS EXCEPT SILICIC ACID
     * Heat of solution: -418.0 BTU/lb= -232.2 cal/g= -9.715X10+5 J/kg
     * Heat capacity constant pressure 138.9 J/mole x deg C (25 deg C)
     * 98% H2SO4 freezes at +3 deg C; 93% at -32 deg C; 78% at -38 deg C;
       74% at -44 deg C; and 65% at -64 deg C.
     * Spent sulfuric acid is a black oily liquid
