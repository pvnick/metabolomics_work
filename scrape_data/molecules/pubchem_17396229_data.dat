   Color/Form

     * Powder or crystals from chloroform + alcohol
     * Light-tan solid
     * WHITE POWDER OR CRYSTALS
     * Pale yellow powder

   from [3]HSDB

   Odor
        Practically odorless
   from [4]HSDB

   Melting Point
        157 deg C (decomposes)
   from [5]HSDB

   Density/Specific Gravity
        Approx 1.74 at 20 deg C
   from [6]HSDB

   Octanol/Water Partition Coefficient
        log Kow = 1.30

   Solubilities

     * Soluble in carbon disulfide, pyridine
     * Soluble in chloroform
     * Soluble in benzene
     * Practically insoluble in common organic solvents. Dissolves in some
       chelating agents, for example salts of ethylediaminetetra-acetic
       acid, from which it cannot be recovered.
     * In water, about 10 mg/L at 25 deg C

   from [8]HSDB

   Spectral Properties

     * Intense mass spectral peaks: 144 m/z (100%), 72 m/z (97%), 76 m/z
       (95%), 102 m/z (94%)
     * Intense mass spectral peaks: 64 m/z (100%), 256 m/z (66%), 128 mz
       (61%), 102 m/z (57%).
     * MASS: 59478 (NIST/EPA/MSDC Mass Spectral Database, 1990 version)
     * IR: 4057 (Coblentz Society spectral collection)

   from [9]HSDB

   Vapor Pressure
        <7.50X10-8 mm Hg at 20 deg C
   from [10]HSDB

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * The powder spreads easily on water, also forms aqueous suspensions
     * VP: 1.0X10-7 mm Hg at 25 deg C
     * Fungicidal activity is due to degradation products, principally
       ethylenethiuram monosulfide.
     * When precipitated from concentrated solution a polymer is formed
       which is less fungicidal.
     * Incompatible with alkaline or mercury-containing compounds.
     * Unstable to light, moisture, and heat on prolonged storage
       (decomposition is reduced by stabilizers).
     * Henry's Law constant = <2.7X10-9 atm-cu m/mole (est)
