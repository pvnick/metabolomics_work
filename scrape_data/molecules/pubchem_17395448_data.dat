   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * 10.0 lb/gallon at 20 deg C; burns with violet flame; aqueous
       solution contains monomolecular glyoxal and reacts weakly with
       acid; glyoxal VP resists discoloration; undergoes many addition &
       condensation reactions with amines, amides, aldehydes &
       hydroxyl-containing materials.
     * Glyoxal is oxidized by dilute nitric acid to glyoxyl acid, & by
       concentrated nitric acid to oxalic acid
     * Anhydrous polymer changes to monomer on heating; non-hygroscopic;
       crystalline powder; more soluble in hot water than in cold water
       /Dihydrate/
     * Conversion factors: 1 mg/L= 422 ppm; 1 ppm= 2.4 mg/cu m
     * Henry's Law constant = 3.33X10-9 atm-cu-m/mol at 25 deg C
     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 1.14X10-11 cu
       cm/molec-sec at 25 deg C
