   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Crystals; MP 109.1 deg C /USP XX/
     * Flakes /Technical/
     * 1 MG/L= 222.3 PPM; 1 PPM= 0.00450 MG/L @ 25 DEG C 760 MM HG
     * Resorcinol crystallizes in the orthorhombic hemimorphic system, and
       its crystals are colorless, triboluminescent, and piezoelectric.
       X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that resorcinol
       crystallizes in the form which is converted to the BETA form at 74
       deg C; the latter is more dense (d= 1.33 g/cu cm), as a result of
       hydrogen bonding between oriented molecules in the crystal lattice.
     * Vapor pressure = 1 mm Hg @ 108.4 deg C
