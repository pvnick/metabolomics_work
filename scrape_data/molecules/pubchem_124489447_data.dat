   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Decomposes at 160 deg C; aqueous soln stable to boiling
     * MELTING POINT: 131-132 DEG C; PH: 5.2 (50 G/KG WATER) /TECHNICAL
       PRODUCT/
     * Boiling point: 107 deg C /60 wt % solution/
     * Dehydrates liquid or solid amides to nitriles. ... Liberates
       ammonia at elevated temperatures and forms ... imidodisulfonates.
     * Forms addition products with formaldehyde and aldehydes in general.
       Readily oxidized by bromine and chlorine.
     * A 60% solution of ammonium sulfamate (pH above 4.5) will not
       undergo rapid hydrolysis below 200 deg C. Addition of acid (to pH
       2) causes a runaway exothermic hydrolysis to set in at 130 deg C.
       Superheating and vigorous boiling can occur under appropriate
       physical conditions.
     * Decomposes at 200 deg C (392 deg F) at 760 mm Hg
     * Nonflammable; hot acid solutions when enclosed may explode
