   Other Chemical/Physical Properties
        Cardiac glycosides have a characteristic ring structure known as
   an aglycone (orgenin) coupled with one or more types of sugars. The
   aglycone portion of the glycoside consists of a steroid nucleus
   (cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene nucleus) and an
   alpha,beta-unsaturated 5- or 6-membered lactone ring at the C17
   position of the steroid nucleus. A beta-oriented hydroxyl substitution
   is usually present at the C3 and C14 positions. Increasing the number
   of hydroxyl groups on the aglycone increases polarity and decreases
   lipid solubility; additional sugars may also increase polarity. The
   sugar portion of the glycoside is attached to the steroid nucleus,
   usually through a hydroxyl group at the C3 position. The sugar moiety
   affects in part the activity of the cardiac glycosides by influencing
   solubility, absorption, distribution, and toxicity. In general, the
   cardiac glycosides are sparingly soluble to insoluble in water and
   freely soluble to slightly soluble in alcohol or diluted alcohol.
