   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * The electronic absorption spectra of the Cu(II), Ni(II) and Co(II)
       chelates of the Schiff bases synthesized from
       5-bromo-salicylaldehyde and sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfamethizole
       and sulfafurazole (sulfisoxazole) were studied in dimethyl
       sulfoxide solution. All the chelates showed an intense charge
       transfer absorption band at the blue end of the visible region. The
       stereochemical characteristics of the chelates were illustrated by
       means of the absorptions caused by the d-d transitions. The Ni(II)
       and Co(II) chelates are 6 coordinated in all cases.
     * The Cu(II), Co(II) and Ni(II) chelates of the Schiff bases formed
       from 5-bromo-salicylaldehyde and sulfamethizole,
       sulfamethoxypyridazine and sulfafurazole(sulfisoxazole) were
       synthesized and an atomic absorption spectrometric method for the
       determination of the metal content of the chelates is described.
       The stoichiometry was found to be 1:1 for all compounds. The metal
       content determined by the described method agreed with theoretical
       values. Structure analysis by infrared spectrometry and x-ray
       diffraction is also included. Thermostability of these Schiff bases
       was investigated using a thermogravimetric method. Decomposition
       began at 200-290 deg C for the Schiff bases, while chelates began
       to decompose at 60-120 deg C. Stable oxides were formed by all
       chelated at 530-800 deg C. The orders and the activation energies
       of some decomposition reactions were calculated for the chelates on
       the basis of the thermograms.
     * The formation and stability of copper, cobalt and nickel chelates
       of the Schiff bases synthesized from the 5-bromo derivatives of
       salicylaldehyde, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfamethizole and
       sulfisoxazole (sulfafurazole) were studied in an absolute
       ethanol-acetone (70:30 v/v) solution.
     * Henry's Law constant = 2.63X10-14 atm-cu m/mol at 25 deg C (est)
     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 2.39X10-11 cu
       cm/molec-sec at 25 deg C (est)
