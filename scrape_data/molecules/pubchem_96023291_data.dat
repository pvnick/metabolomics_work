   Color/Form

     * CRYSTALIZES FROM DIETHYL ETHER AS ROSETTES OF NEEDLES; FROM BENZENE
       & ETHYL ACETATE AS LONG LATHES; HEXAGONAL PLATES FROM AMYL ACETATE
     * Crystalline

   from [1]HSDB

   Melting Point
        168-170 deg C (dec.)
   from [2]HSDB

   Dissociation Constants
        PKA= 4.69
   from [3]HSDB

   Spectral Properties

     * SPECIFIC OPTICAL ROTATION: +6.25 DEG @ 28 DEG C/D; MAX ABSORPTION
       (ACETONITRILE): 250 NM (E= 10,300)
     * Max absorption (acetonitrile) = 251 nm (e=9700)
     * Specific optical rotation: +67 deg (acetone, 20 deg C, c=2)
     * Mass spectrum, peak at m/e 474

   from [4]HSDB

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Very soluble in acetone, moderately soluble in alcohol and esters
       and only sparingly soluble in water; completely insoluble in
       non-polar solvents /Rubratoxins/
     * Infra-red spectra reveal strong absorption in the carbonyl
       region... strong absorption at about 3500 cm-1 /Rubratoxins/
     * THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RUBRATOXINS IS THAT ONE OF THE
       ANHYDRIDE GROUPS OF RUBRATOXIN B IS REDUCED TO THE LACTOL IN THE A
       TOXIN
     * PARTIALLY SOL IN WATER, FAIRLY SOL IN ALC & ESTERS & VERY SOL IN
       ACETONE /RUBRATOXINS/
     * INSOL IN OILS OR CHLOROFORM /RUBRATOXINS/
