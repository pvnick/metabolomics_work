     * Apparent partition coefficients (K*, in M/atm) of 15 carbonyl
       compounds including octylaldehyde between water and air were
       determined as a function of temperature, salinity, and pH. Values
       for K* decreased with increasing carbon number of alkanals; eg, at
       25 deg C apparent partition coefficients between air and seawater
       range from 3710 for formaldehyde and 13.1 for acetaldehyde to 0.181
       for decanal. log K* was found-to be highly temperature dependent,
       varying linearly with l/T for all compounds studied. The salinity
       effect on K* increases with increasing molecular weight; K*
       (seawater)/K*(freshwater) ratios range from close to 1 for
       formaldehyde and acetaldehyde to less than 0.3 for nonanal and
       decanal. The effect of pH in the range of 4-8 on K* as found to be
       negligible.
