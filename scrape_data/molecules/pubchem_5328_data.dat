   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Mp: also reported as 204-209.5 deg C with darkening at > 150 deg C.
     * Pentostatin differs from the physiologic nucleosides, adenosine and
       deoxyadenosine, by the interposition of a methylene group between
       N-1 and C-6 of the purine ring, resulting in a 7-membered
       (imidazobenzopin) rather than a 6-membered ring, and by the
       deletion of an amino group from, and the addition of a hydroxyl
       group to, the ring; the sugar moiety, deoxyribose, is common to
       both pentostatin and deoxyadenosine, while adenosine contains
       ribose. The resultant stereochemical and tautomeric differences in
       the compounds provide an increased binding affinity of pentostatin
       for the catalytic center of adenosine deaminase compared with the
       affinities of these physiologic substrates for the enzyme.
       Pentostatin is thought to resemble closely the transition-state
       intermediates of the adenosine deaminase reaction involving these
       nucleosides (ie, the intermediaries formed during the deamination
       of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine,
       respectively), The drug is a purine antagonist antimetabolite that
       acts as an adenosine deaminase inhibitor.
