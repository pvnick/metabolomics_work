   Other Chemical/Physical Properties
        /Toxic equivalency factors (TEF), indicate the toxicity of a
   compound relative to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, which itself
   has been assigned a TEF of 1.0. Concentration data for polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins are frequently reported in units of toxic equivalency
   which are equal to the measured concentration of substance multiplied
   by its TEF./ The TEF for 1,2,3,7,8,9-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is 0.1.
