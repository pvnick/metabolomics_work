   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * A 2% AQ SOLN SHOWED A DEPRESSION OF SURFACE TENSION OF WATER OF
       38.5% @ 37 DEG C
     * DILUTE AQ SOLN ARE BLUE & TURN YELLOW UPON ADDITION OF CONCN
       HYDROCHLORIC ACID; IN ABSENCE OF STRONG ACID OR CAUSTIC THE BLUE
       COLOR IS STABLE OVER WIDE PH RANGE
     * C.I. Acid Blue 1 displays acid-base-indicator properties, turning
       orange in the presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid and deep
       blue when sodium hydroxide is added.
