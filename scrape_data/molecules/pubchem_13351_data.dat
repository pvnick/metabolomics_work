   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Crystals or white powder or granules. Also occurs as the
       monohydrate and pentahydrate. One gram dissolves in approx 2.5 mL
       water, in approx 15 mL alc. pH of 1% aq soln 9.35; of 10% soln
       10.2. /Sodium salt sesquihydrate/
     * Amorphous powder. Practically insol in water /Polymer with
       formaldehyde/
     * The microstructure of sulfathiazole crystals obtained by
       recrystallization at 0, 30, and 70DGC was studied using high
       resolution transmission electron microscopy. Low magnification
       electron microscopy study of the crystals showed featureless
       morphology, yet the resolved lattice images showed imperfections
       such as dislocations, lattice irregularities and regions of
       discontinuity.
     * Several interfacial and partitioning processes were incorporated
       into a mathematical model describing the in vitro diffusion of drug
       from a submicron oil-in-water emulsion across a semipermeable
       membrane. Drug ionization and its effects on charge dependent
       interfacial, partitioning and mass transport processes are
       considered. Release studies using sulfathiazole as a test compound
       were found to be consistent with the model.
     * X-ray diffraction and infrared spectrophotometric studies were
       carried out to determine interactions between cellulose acetate
       phthalate film coatings and either sulfathiazole or sulfathiazole
       sodium in tablets. A surface interaction was noted when the sodium
       salt was used.
     * The stability of sulfathiazole in hydrochloric acid at elevated
       temperatures was investigated. Two hydrolytic decomposition
       products were isolated and identified using LC with UV detection.
     * Crystal growth of sulfathiazole in aqueous suspension was studied
       using a projecting microscope. Temperature, agitation,
       concentration of povidone and suspension concentration effects on
       crystal growth were examined. Povidone concentration in excess of
       one percent inhibited the growth rate. Agitation, temperature
       increase and a decrease in suspension concentration had significant
       growth accelerating effects.
     * Henry's Law constant = 5.85X10-14 atm-cu m/mol at 25 deg C (est)
     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 5.63X10-11 cu
