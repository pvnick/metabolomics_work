   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Slightly unctuous to touch; volatile with steam; solubility in
       water increased by hydrochloric, citric or tartaric acids
     * Loses 1.5H2O at 300 deg C
     * Standard enthalpy of formation: -1094.3 kJ/mol (crystal); -994.1
       kJ/mol (gas); molar heat capacity: 86.1 J/K mol at 25 deg C
     * pH at 20 deg C: 6.1 (0.1% solution); 5.1 (1.0% solution); 3.7 (4.5%
       solution)
     * Dissolves in water with hydrolysis to form boric acid and the
       corresponding alcohol or phenol /Boric acid esters/
     * Boric acid will form soluble salts with monovalent cations (e.g.
       Na2B407.1OH20, 6% in water) and insoluble salts with divalent
       cations (e.g. CaB407.6H20, almost insoluble in cold water).
