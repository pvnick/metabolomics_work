       (46%), 45 m/z (37%)
     * SRP: The scientific literature for the use of contact lenses in
       industry is conflicting. The benefit or detrimental effects of
       wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also
       on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and
       duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection
       equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be
       individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are
       such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the
       eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In
       any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even
       when contact lenses are in place.
