   Color/Form

     * Alpha-sulfur, orthorhombic cyclooctasulfur. Amber-colored crystals.
       When heated becomes opaque owing to the formation of monoclinic
       sulfur.
     * Beta-sulfur, monoclinic cyclooctasulfur. Opaque, light-yellow,
       brittle, needle-like crystals.
     * Sublimed & washed sulfur are in form of fine, yellow crystalline
       powder /Pharmaceutical/
     * Precipitated sulfur is in form of very fine, pale yellow, amorphous
       or microcrystalline powder /Pharmaceutical/
     * Yellow solid or amber-colored molten liquid.
     * Pure sulfur exists in two stable crystalline forms, alpha and beta,
       and at least two amorphous (liquid) forms. Alpha-sulfur: rhombic,
       octahedral, yellow crystals; beta-sulfur: monoclinic, prismatic,
       pale-yellow crystals.

   Odor

     * Pure sulfur is odorless, but traces of hydrocarbon impurity may
       impart an oily and/or rotten egg odor
     * Faint odor /Pharmaceutical/

   materials. However, acid-generating impurities, which may be introduced
   in handling and storage, create corrosive conditions.
