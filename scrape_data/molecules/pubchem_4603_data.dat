   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Volatile, especially above 90 deg C, but sublimate is not
       crystalline.
     * Cocaine is an ester of benzoic acid and a nitrogen-containing base.
     * Melting point 197 deg C /Cocaine hydrochloride, L-form/
     * Specific rotation -72 deg C (concn= 2% in aq soln pH 4.5); 1 g
       dissolves in 0.4 ml water; 3.2 ml cold, 2 ml hot alcohol; 12.5 ml
       chloroform; also sol in glycerol, acetone. Insoluble in ether or
       oils. /Cocaine hydrochloride/
     * Odorless, hygroscopic, colorless crystalline powder with a bitter
       sharp numbing taste. MP about 197 deg C with decomposition. Cocaine
       hydrochloride 1.12 g is approx equivalent to 1 g of cocaine.
       Incompatible with alkali hydroxides and carbonates, mercuric
       chloride, iodides, tannic acid, and soluble silver salts. It is
       incompatible with borax but a clear aq solution may be made by
       dissolving equal weights of borax and boric acid by adding the
       cocaine hydrochloride in solution. /Cocaine hydrochloride/
     * Crystals; MP 58-63 deg C; freely sol in water or alcohol, slightly
       sol in ether. /Cocaine nitrate dihydrate/
     * White, granular, crystalline powder; sol in water or alcohol.
       /Cocaine sulfate/
     * The hydrochloric acid solution is levorotatory.
