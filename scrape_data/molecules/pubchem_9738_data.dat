   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * 1 PPM IS EQUIVALENT TO 10.32 MG/CU M (WT/VOL)
     * Dilute benzene solutions exhibit violet fluorescence
     * Oxidation of a solution of /benzo(a)pyrene/ in acetone by Milas
       reagent (dilution of hydrogen peroxide to 20-40% with tert-butanol
       and addition of 1-2% osmium tetroxide in tert-butanol) leads to
       production of 2,8-,5,10-, and 6,7-quinones.
     * Oxidation /of benzo(a)pyrene/ in presence of pyridine in
       acetonitrile, using tetraethylammonium perchlorate as electrolyte,
       leads to N-(6-benzo[a]pyrenyl) pyridinium salt in high yield.
     * Oxidation with ozone yields benzo(a)pyrene-(1,6 or 3,6)-quinone, &,
       on further oxidation, benzanthrone dicarboxylic anhydride. Readily
       undergoes nitration & halogenation. Reacts with NO /nitric oxide/ &
       NO2 /nitrogen dioxide/ to form nitro derivatives.
     * Benzo(a)pyrene dissolved in benzene was irradiated by ultraviolet
       light of a wavelength greater than 280 mu. Oxygen was present in
       the benzene. ... /Three crystalline/ compounds /were identified/ as
       6,12-benzo(a)pyrenequinone, 1,6-benzo(a)pyrenequinone, and
       3,6-benzo(a)pyrenequinone.
     * Forms a picrate (dark red needles from benzene) and a red complex
       with 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene
     * Heat of fusion: 15.69 cal/g (65.65 J/g; 16,564 J/mol)
     * Boiling point: > 360 deg C at 760 mm Hg
     * Undergoes photooxidation after irradiation in indoor sunlight or by
       fluorescent light in organic solvents.
     * Adsorption and fluorescent spectra, fluorescent quantum yields,
       decay times, and O quenching constants of benzo(a)pyrene and
       benzo(e)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(j)fluoranthene,
       benzo(k)fluoranthene, indleno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene,
       and cyclopenta(cd)pyrene, and of other airborne polycyclic aromatic
       hydrocarbons (PAH) were measured with and without oxygen in heptane
       at room temperature. ... This data can be used for optimal analysis
       of PAH by fluorescence spectrometry. The differences in the oxygen
       quenching of the fluorescent state of the various PAH can be used
       to analyze PAH mixtures which are difficult to separate by
       chromatographic techniques.
     * Henry's Law constant = 4.57X10-7 atm-cu m/mole at 25 deg C
     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molec-sec
       at 25 deg C (est)
