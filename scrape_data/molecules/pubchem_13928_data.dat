   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Rapidly hydrolyzed by dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide or sodium
       carbonate forming relatively non-toxic products.
     * Hydrolyzed by water
     * Volatility: 21,900 mg/cu m at 25 deg C
     * G-agents are miscible in both polar and nonpolar solvents. They
       hydrolyze slowly in water at neutral or slightly acidic pH and more
       rapidly under strong acid or alkaline conditions. The hydrolysis
       products are considerably less toxic than the original agent.
     * Although the G-agents are liquids under ordinary atmospheric
       conditions, their relatively high volatility permits them to be
       disseminated in vapor form.
     * Colorless, odorless /G-agents/
     * In the nerve gas known as Sarin, one of the isopropoxy groups of
       diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP), is replaced by a methyl
       group.
     * Henry's Law constant = 5.72X10-7 atm-m cu/mole at 25 deg C (est)
     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 4.02X10-11 cu
       cm/molec-sec at 25 deg C (est)
