   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Readily attacked by diluted mineral acids and attacked or dissolved
       by organic acids.
     * Not appreciably attacked by cold concentrated /sulfuric acid/ or
       /nitric acid/, but is attacked by the hot acids.
     * Four naturally occurring isotopes (54)Fe (5.82%), (56)Fe (91.66%),
       (57)Fe (2.19%), (58)Fe (0.33%).
     * Valences 2, 3; seldom 1, 4, 6
     * Density: ...cast 7.76; wrought 7.25-7.78; steel 7.6-7.78.
     * Melting point: ...cast 1000-1300 deg C; wrought 1500 deg C; steel
       1300 deg C
     * Somewhat magnetic metal; holds magnetism only after hardening (as
       alloy steel, e.g. Alnico).
     * Electrical resistivity (20 deg C): 9.71 microhm-cm
     * Iron, in an almost pure state, loses its magnetism when removed
       from an electric field; when iron contains small amounts of carbon,
       cobalt, or nickel, the retention of magnetism is increased. When
       heated to 770 deg C, iron loses its magnetism; on cooling, it
       retains this property.
     * Heat of formation: 0.0 kJ/mol @ 298.15 K (crystal), 416.3 kJ/mol @
       298.15 K (gas); Gibbs energy of formation: 370.7 kJ/mol @ 298.15 K
       (gas); Molar entropy: 27.3 J/mol K @ 298.15 K (crystal), 180.5
       J/mol K @ 298.15 K (gas); Molar heat capacity at constant pressure:
       25.1 J/mol K @ 298.15 K (crystal), 25.7 J/mol K @ 298.15 K (gas).
     * Enthalpy of fusion: 13.81 kJ/mol @ 1538 deg C
     * Thermal conductivity: at 0 deg C 79 W/(m.K); tensile strength:
       240-280 MPa; Brinell hardness: 82-100; specific heat: 0.50 J/(g.K)
       at 100 deg C, 0.67 J/(g.K) at 500 deg C, 1.26 J/(g.K) at 800 deg C
