   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Plutonium exists as a number of isotopes. The common isotope
       plutonium-239 is an alpha emitter (5 MeV); plutonium-238 is also an
       alpha emitter. Plutonium exhibits valences (3+) to (6+) in
       solutions, but in most common biological and physiological
       conditions it occurs as Pu(4+). /Plutonium isotopes/
     * All plutonium isotopes are radioactive. Isotopes with even mass
       numbers (except mass number 246) are primarily alpha emitters.
       Isotopes of mass numbers 232, 233, 234, 235, and 237 also decay by
       electron capture; isotopes of mass numbers 241, 243, 245, and 246
       decay by beta emission. Many of the alpha-emitting isotopes, such
       as plutonium-238 and plutonium-240, also fission spontaneously and
       emit neutrons. All of the particle emissions are accompanied by
       X-ray and gamma-ray emissions over a wide range of energies.
       /Plutonium isotopes/
     * While several plutonium nuclides can fission, only plutonium-239 is
       of practical importance as a criticality concern. /Plutonium-239/
     * Absolute entropy of alpha-plutonium at 298 K= 55.4461 J/(mol.K);

       /Plutonium allotropes/
     * The metal has a bright, silver-like appearance at first, but it
       oxidizes very quickly to a dull gray. It is about as hard and
       brittle as gray cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to
       make it soft and ductile. Although it is a metal, it is not a good
       conductor of heat or electricity like most other metals. /Plutonium
       metal/
     * Metallic plutonium readily dissolves in concentrated HCl, H3PO4,
       HI, or HClO4; nitric acid forms a protective oxide coating on the
       metal that can be removed by ca. 0.05 M HF; plutonium metal does
       not readily dissolve in H2SO4; alpha-plutonium oxidizes very slowly
       in dry air, the bright metal surface tarnishes rapidly in normal
       environments and a powdery surface forms, eventually green PuO2
       covers the surface; the reaction of plutonium metal with liquid
       water produces both oxides and oxide-hydroxides; the reaction with
       water vapor above 100 deg C produces oxides and hydride. /Plutonium
       metal forms/
     * The metallic state of plutonium is undoubtedly the most complicated
       of all the elements. Plutonium is a silvery-white metal, much like
       nickel in appearance. It has a low melting point (640 deg C) and an
       unusually high boiling point (3,327deg C). The metal exists in six
       allotropic forms. Two of the allotropic forms contract upon
       heating; the other forms expand upon heating. At room temperature,
       pure plutonium ... has a triclinic structure with a theoretical
       density of about 19.86 g/cu cm. ... The combination of a high
       specific activity and low thermal conductivity can result in
       significant dimensional distortion during metal-forming operations.
       For this reason, a .. gallium alloy, which has a density of about
       15.75 g/cu cm, is used when a more dimensionally stable plutoniuum
       is desired. /Plutonium metal/
     * Plutonium is an active metal. In moist air or moist argon, the
       metal oxidizes rapidly, producing a mixture of oxides and hydrides.
       If the metal is exposed long enough, an olive-green powdery surface
       coating of PuO2 is formed. With this coating, the metal is
       pyrophoric, so plutonium metal is usually handled in an inert, dry
       atmosphere of nitrogen or argon. Oxygen retards the effects of
       moisture and acts as a passivating agent. /Plutonium metal/
     * Plutonium metal also reacts with most common gases at elevated
       temperatures. Plutonium metal is rapidly dissolved by HCl, HBr, 72%
       HClO4, 85% H3PO4, concentrated CCl3COOH (trichloroacetic acid),
       sulfamic acid, and boiling concentrated HNO3 in the presence of
       0.005M HF. The metal reacts slowly with water, dilute sulfuric
       acid, and dilute acetic acid. There is no reaction with the metal
       in pure HNO3 at any concentration, with concentrated acetic acid,
       nor with dilute sodium hydroxide. /Plutonium metal/
     * Valence: 3,4,5, and 6; 19 known isotopes
     * In aqueous solutions, plutonium (III) is oxidized into plutonium
       (IV), which is the most stable state. The compounds PuF4, Pu(I03)4,
       Pu(OH)4, and Pu(C2O4)2 6H2O (plutonium oxalate) are insoluble in
       water. The chlorides, nitrates, perchlorates, and sulfates are
       soluble in water. Plutonium (IV) ions complex readily with organic
       and inorganic compounds. /Plutonium compounds/
     * Plutonium (IV) nitrate is the most used of all plutonium compounds.
       Essentially all chemical processing of plutonium has been conducted
       in nitrate solutions. These solutions of appropriate acidities
       range from concentrations of 10 grams to 250 grams of Pu/L for
       efficient precipitation processes. Intermediate compounds are also
       used in the processing of plutonium prepared from the nitrate:
       plutonium (III) fluoride, plutonium (II or IV) oxalate, and
       plutonium peroxide. Plutonium (IV) fluoride can be prepared from
       any of the preceding solids by hydrofluorination. Plutonium
       fluoride has been the compound of choice for reduction to the metal
       with calcium, principally because it is nonhygroscopic. /Plutonium
       compounds/
     * Plutonium hexafluoride is the only volatile plutonium compound (bp
       62 deg C) and is marginally stable. It can be prepared by oxidizing
       PuF4 with F2 at an elevated temperature. It can also be prepared at
       low temperatures by a fluorinating agent, fluorine dioxide.
       /Plutonium hexafluoride/
     * Plutonium dioxide is formed when plutonium or its compounds (except
       the phosphates) are ignited in air, and often results when
       oxygen-containing compounds are heated in vacuo or in an inert
       atmosphere to 1,000 deg C. Loose PuO2 powder, as formed by
       calcination, usually has a density of about 2 g/cm3. If the oxide
       is pressed and sintered into pellets, it may have a density of
       about 10.3 to 11.0 g/cm3. ... Plutonium oxide fired at temperatures
       >600 C is difficult to rapidly or completely dissolve in common
       acids or molten salts. The best solvents are 12 to 16M HNO3 with
       0.10 to 0.1M HF, 5 to 6M HI, and 9M HBr. /Plutonium oxides/
     * General solubility characteristics include the insolubility of the
       hydroxides, fluorides, iodates, phosphates, carbonates, and
       oxalates of Pu+3 and Pu+4. Some of these can be dissolved in acid
       solution, however. The corresponding compounds of PuO2 +1 and PuO2
       +2 are soluble, with the exception of the hydroxides. The binary
       compounds represented by the carbides, silicides, sulfides, and
       selenides are of particular interest because of their refractory
       nature. One of the complicating factors of plutonium chemistry is
       the formation of a polymeric material by hydrolysis in dilute acid
       or neutral solutions. The polymeric material can be a complicating
       factor in radiochemical procedures and be quite unyielding in
       attempts to destroy it.
     * The equilibration problems of plutonium are among the most complex
       encountered in radiochemistry. Of the five oxidation states that
       plutonium may have, the first four are present in solution as Pu+3,
       Pu+4, PuO2 +1, PuO2 +2. They coexist in dilute acid solution, and
       sometimes all four are present in substantial quantities. Problems
       of disproportionation and auto-oxidation in freshly prepared
       solutions also complicate the chemistry of plutonium. ... The +4
       ion can form long chain polymers that do not exhibit the usual
       chemical behavior of the +4 oxidation state. Finally, the different
       oxidation states exhibit radically different chemical behavior. As
       a result of these effects, it is possible to mix a plutonium sample
       with plutonium tracer, subject the mixture to a relatively severe
       chemical treatment using hot acids or similar reagents, and still
       selectively recover portions of either the tracer or the sample.
       This characteristic explains the challenge in achieving
       reproducible radiochemical results for plutonium.
     * Apart from the disproportionation reactions, the oxidation state of
       plutonium ions in solution is affected by its own decay radiation
       or external gamma and X-rays. At high levels, radiolysis products
       of the solution can oxidize or reduce the plutonium, depending on
       the nature of the solution and the oxidation state of plutonium.
       Therefore, the stated oxidation states of old plutonium solutions,
       particularly old HClO4 and H2SO4 solutions, should be viewed with
       suspicion. Plutonium also tends to hydrolyze and polymerize in
       solution, further complicating the situation.
