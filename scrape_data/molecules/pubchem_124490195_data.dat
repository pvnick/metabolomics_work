   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Standard molar enthalpy of formation at 298.15 K: -307.0 kJ/mol
     * Triclinic leaflets, becomes anhydrous at 38 deg C or in desiccator
       over potassium hydroxide at room temperature /Sodium chlorite
       trihydrate/
     * White solid; may have a greenish tint from trace amounts of ClO2 or
       metals such as iron /Technical grade (80% wt assay)/
     * Strong oxidizer.
     * Sodium chlorite is a strong oxidizing agent and under proper
       reducing conditions is readily reduced to chloride, and to a lesser
       extent, chlorate. In strong acidic conditions, chlorite can change
       into chlorine dioxide. ...
