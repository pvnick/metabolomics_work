   Solubilities

     * Practically insoluble in water. Complex is slowly decomposed by
       trituration with water, or more rapidly by dilute aqueous acids.
     * Slightly soluble in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide
       (DMF); insoluble in water and ethanol, however it decomposes slowly
       when mixed with them

   Spectral Properties

     * UV/vis absorption max: 300-360 nm
     * UV max (concd H2SO4): 298 nm (A 1%/1cm 670)

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Nicarbazin is a complex of two compounds, 4,4'-dinitrocarbanilide
       (DNC, 302.35 molecular weight) and 4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidinol (HDP,
       124.14 molecular weight). DNC is considered the active ingredient
       while HDP aids in adsorption.
     * The dry crystals are strongly electrostatic and present some drying
       problems.
     * Yellowish-tan solid, round to oblong, semisoft kibbles. None to
       slight grain odor. Density: 25-33 lbs/bushel. /OvoControl-G/
