   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Freezing point: -70 deg C
     * Volatility: 3,060 mg/cu m at 25 deg C
     * G-agents are miscible in both polar and nonpolar solvents. They
       hydrolyze slowly in water at neutral or slightly acidic pH and more
       rapidly under strong acid or alkaline conditions. The hydrolysis
       products are considerably less toxic than the original agent.
       /G-agents/
     * Although the G-agents are liquids under ordinary atmospheric
       conditions, their relatively high volatility permits them to be
       disseminated in vapor form. /G-agents/
     * Colorless, odorless /G-agents/
     * Density: 1.026 at 20 deg C
     * GB and other G-agents react with perhydryl ions at pH 9 to 10 to
       form a perphosphonate ion, which has a sufficiently high redox
       potential to oxidize indole or o-dianisidine to produce colored
       products. /G-agents/
     * Reacts readily with nucleophiles, hypochlorite anions, peroxide
       anions, phenols, oximes, hydroxamic acids, amines, alcoholates.
     * Henry's Law constant = 4.57X10-6 atm-cu m/mol at 25 deg C (est)
     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 4.97X10-11 cu
       cm/molec-sec at 25 deg C (est)
