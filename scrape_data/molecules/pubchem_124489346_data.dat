   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * In methylmercuric bromide, the covalent-binding of H3CHg+ is more
       firm and stable than the ionic Hg-Br bond; CH3Hg+ can exist free
       only in minute concentrations; the affinity of CH3Hg+ for some
       ligands is high, esp toward thiol group
     * Methylmercury(II) complexes of most widely studied antidotes for
       mercury poisoning were prepared, and the water solubility and
       1-octanol/water partition coefficients determined for these
       complexes and the l-cysteine complex. [Arnold AP et al; J Inorg
       Biochem 19 (4): 319-28 (1983)] [1]PubMed Abstract
     * Conversion factors: 1 ppm = 1 mg/kg = 1 ug/g = 1 ng/mg. 1 ppm = 1
       ug/kg = 1 ng/g. 1 umol mercury = 1 umol methylmercury = 200 ug
       mercury.
     * Methylmercury can react with free S-H groups of biologically
       important molecules, leading to diseases that have been caused by
       mercury and its derivatives (Minamata, Niigata, Iraq).
