       organic solvents. Slowly soluble in 30 parts cold, about 5 parts
       boiling water
     * Insoluble in acetic acid
     * Sol in water 3.3 g/100 cc at 15 deg C

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Soln is neutral to litmus paper
     * Does not lose its water on drying without some decomp
     * Stable in air. Loses water at 120 deg C.
     * Calcium gluconate is decomposed by dilute mineral acids into
       gluconic acid and the calcium salt of the mineral acid used. It is
       precipitated from its aqueous solution by the addition of alcohol.
