   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * A yellow modification which has no metallic properties is obtained
       by sudden cooling of arsenic-vapor. This yellow arsenic is
       converted back to the gray modification upon very short exposure to
       ultraviolet light.
     * Vaporization becomes apparent at 100 deg C and is already rapid at
       450 deg C; Brinell hardness: 147; Mohs' scale: 3.5; heat of
       sublimation: 30.5 kcal/g-atom; 7.63 kcal/g-atom; specific heat:
       0.0822 for 0 deg C to 100 deg C; heat of fusion: 22.4 kcal/g-atom;
       6.620 kcal/g-atom; not attacked by cold sulfuric acid or
       hydrochloric acid; converted by HNO3 or hot H2SO4 into arsenous or
       arsenic acid; dielectric constant: 10.23 @ 20 deg C and 60 cycles
     * Triple point: 817 deg C; sublimes at 614 deg C; specific gravity:
       1.97 (yellow modification), 5.73 (gray or metallic modification)

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Dissociation pressure at 0 deg C = 0.806 atm; decomposes when
       heated at 300 deg C; depositing arsenic; on exposure to light,
       moist arsine decomposes quickly depositing shiny black arsenic.
     * CONVERSION FACTORS: 1 MG/CU M IS EQUIVALENT TO 0.313 PPM, 1 PPM IS
       EQUIVALENT TO 3.2 MG/CU M AT 25 DEG C, 760 MM HG
     * At temperatures below -10 deg C or under pressure arsine
       hexahydrate, AsH3.6H2O, is formed.
     * One mole of AsH3= 0.077946 kg; Specific volume at 21.1 deg C,
       101.325 kPa; Triple point: 156.22 K, -116.9 deg C, -178.5 deg F;
       Latent heat of fusion at -116.9 deg C: 3.665 kcal/kg; Dipole moment

       deg C (solid); 40 mm Hg at -110.2 deg C; 100 mm Hg at -98.0 deg C;
       400 mm Hg at -75.2 deg C.
     * Can explode on contact with warm, dry air.
     * Must be stored in a glass lined cannister; steel lined cannisters
       will cause decomposition.
     * Arsine hydrolyses rapidly in water to arsenic acids and hydrides.
     * Volatility is 30,900 g/min/cu m at 0 deg C.
     * Latent heat of vaporization: 53.7 cal/g at -62.5 deg C.

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * The pH of aqueous solutions appears to be the major factor in the
       relative stability of either valence form. It was found that
       trivalent arsenic in solutions at pH of 7.0 or 9.6 were oxidized to
       the extent of 70-90% within one week, compared to 25% conversion at
       pH 4.8. ... Rapid oxidation of As (III) in aqueous solution occurs
       at room temperature, while storage at 4 deg C showed little
       conversion. /Inorganic arsenic/
     * Arsenates are oxidizing agents and are reduced by concn
       hydrochloric acid or sulfur dioxide. /Arsenates/
     * ARSENITES OF ALKALI METALS ARE SLOWLY CONVERTED IN SOLN TO
       ARSENATES BY ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN; & DECOMPOSED BY ATMOSPHERIC CARBON
       DIOXIDE
