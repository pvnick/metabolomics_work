   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * As a group, the chlorophenols are characterized by an odor which
       has been described as unpleasant, medicinal, pungent, phenolic,
       strong, or persistent. /Chlorinated phenols/
     * The ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the anion exhibits a maximum
       absorption peak at 311 nm while the undissociated form has an
       absorption maximum at 286 nm.
     * Can be converted to sodium salt by reaction with sodium carbonate;
       The hydroxyl group forms ethers, esters, and salts with metals and
       amines; Aromatic portion undergoes substitution reactions such as
       nitration, alkylation, acetylation and halogenation; ... Oxidative
       decomposition occurs with strong oxidizing agents.
