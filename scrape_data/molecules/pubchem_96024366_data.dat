   Solubilities

     * 0.1% in hot water.
     * Less than 20 ppm in water at 20 deg C.
     * Miscible with organic solvents.
     * Water solubility of 4 mg/l at pH 7.0 and 20 deg C.
     * The solubility of bis(tributyltin) oxide in water ranges from <1 to
       >100 mg/liter, depending on temperature and pH. Bis(tributyltin)
       oxide is soluble in lipids and very soluble in a number of organic
       solvents (e.g., ethanol, ether, halogenated hydrocarbons).
