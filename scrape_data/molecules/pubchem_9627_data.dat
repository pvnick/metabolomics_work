   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * The pK values of the hypnotically active barbituric acids range
       between 7.78 and 8.30. Disubstituted barbituric acids are present,
       to ca. 50 %, in the undissociated form under physiological
       conditions (pH 7.4). Only this form of the drug can pass through
       biological membranes. The degree of dissociation is strongly
       influenced by slight alterations in pH.
     * A polymorphic form may occur, with a mp of about 115 deg C; it
       gradually reverts to the more stable form on heating at about 110
       deg C.
     * A white, hygroscopic, crystalline powder or granules, odorless or
       with a slight characteristic odor, with a slightly bitter taste.
       Very sol in water and alcohol; practically insol in ether. A 10%
       soln in water has pH of 9.6 to 11 and slowly decomposes.
       /Pentobarbitone sodium/
     * A fine, white, odorless, crystalline powder with a slightly bitter
       taste. Sparingly sol in water; slightly sol in alcohol; practically
       insol in ether. A saturated soln in water has a pH of about 9.5.
       /Pentobarbital calcium/
     * Soln is alkaline to litmus & to phenolphthalein; pKa1: 8.17; pKa2:
       12.67 /Pentobarbital sodium/
     * White powder; slightly bitter taste. Decomp at about 127 deg C.
       Freely soluble in water, alcohol. Practically insoluble in benzene,
       ether. Aqueous solutions are unstable. /Pentobarbital sodium/
     * Henry's Law constant = 8.4X10-13 atm-cu m/mol at 25 deg C (est)
     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 1.8X10-11 cu cm/molec-sec
       at 25 deg C (est)
