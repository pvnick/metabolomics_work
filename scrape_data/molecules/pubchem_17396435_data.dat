   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Wt/gal = 8.86 lb
     * Phthalate esters are soluble to various extents in many common
       organic solvents and oils, but have a relatively low solubility in
       water. /Phthalate esters/
     * Most phthalate esters have a relatively high calculated log
       octanol/water partition coefficient > 2.12 indicating that they are
       lipophilic. /Phthalate esters/
     * Phthalate esters would be expected to have UV maxima in the 230 nm
       and 270 nm regions. /Phthalate esters/
     * Fast to light, water-resistant.
     * ... Resistance to migration from polymers, low temperature
       flexibility ... compatibility with polar polymers and additives
       over a wide range of compositions. /Phthalate esters/
