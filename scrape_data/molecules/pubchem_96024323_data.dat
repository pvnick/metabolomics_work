   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * When heated to decomposition, it emits toxic fumes of Cl+.
     * /Toxic equivalency factors (TEF), indicate the toxicity of a
       compound relative to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, which
       itself has been assigned a TEF of 1.0. Concentration data for
       polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins are frequently reported in units
       of toxic equivalency which are equal to the measured concentration
       of substance multiplied by its TEF./ The TEF for
       2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran is 0.5.
     * Henry's Law constant: 5.01X10-6 atm-cu m/mole @ 25 deg C
