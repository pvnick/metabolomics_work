   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * CONSTANT HUMIDITY: 88.4% at 103.5 deg C and 760 mm Hg aq tension
     * Heat of Solution: 23 cal/g (41 Btu/lb or 0.96X10+5 J/kg)
       /HNO3.PB(X)/
     * Above 205 deg C, oxygen and nitrogen dioxide are driven off, and
       basic lead nitrates are formed. Above 470 deg C, decomposes to lead
       monoxide and Pb3O4.
     * Lead is derived from the decay of radon. /Inorganic lead/
     * Natural lead is a mixture of four stable isotopes: Pb-204 (1.4%),
       Pb-206 (25.2%), Pb-207 (21.7%) and Pb-208 (51.7%). Lead isotopes
       are the end-products of each of the three series of naturally
       occurring radioactive elements: Pb-206 for the uranium series,
       Pb-207 for the actinium series and Pb-208 for the thorium series.
       Forty-three other isotopes of lead, all of which are radioactive,
       are recognized.
     * Divalent lead has a strong affinity for inorganic ions containing
       oxygen (eg, carbonate) or sulfur (sulfide). Lead can also complex
       with electron rich ligands in many organic cmpd such as amino
       acids, proteins, and humic acid.
