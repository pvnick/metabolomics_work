   Other Chemical/Physical Properties
        Acebutolol is related structurally to atenolol and metoprolol in
   that the drugs contain substituents in the para position of the benzene
   ring; however acebutlol differs from these drugs in that it also
   contains an acetyl group at position 3 in benzene ring. /Acebutolol/
