   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Lead is derived from the decay of radon. /Inorganic lead/
     * Natural lead is a mixture of four stable isotopes: Pb-204 (1.4%),
       Pb-206 (25.2%), Pb-207 (21.7%) and Pb-208 (51.7%). Lead isotopes
       are the end-products of each of the three series of naturally
       occurring radioactive elements: Pb-206 for the uranium series,
       Pb-207 for the actinium series and Pb-208 for the thorium series.
       Forty-three other isotopes of lead, all of which are radioactive,
       are recognized.
