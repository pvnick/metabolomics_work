   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * ODORLESS; DIHYDRATE IS HYGROSCOPIC; WHITE CRYSTALLINE POWDER; 1 G
       SOL IN ABOUT 1 ML H2O & ABOUT 350 ML ALC /CHLORIDE/
     * Slightly hygroscopic crystals, mp 225 deg C. Freely sol in water or
       normal saline, giving solns which are very slightly acidic.
       /Bromide/
     * Exists as a dihydrate at room temperature, crystals, mp 156-163 deg
       C. Anhydrous form mp approximately 190 deg C. Slightly bitter
       taste. Freely soluble in water (about 1 g/1 ml water). Solubility
       in 95% ethanol: 0.42 g/ 100 ml. Sparingly soluble in benzene,
       chloroform. Practically insoluble in ether. The pH of a 2-5%
       aqueous solution may vary from 4.5 to 3.0. /Chloride/
     * White, odorless, slightly bitter powder and very soluble in water.
       ...unstable in alkaline solutions but relatively stable in acid
       solutions. /Chloride/
     * Slightyl hygroscopic crystals, mp 243-245 deg C. Freely soluble in
       water or normal saline, giving solutions which are very slightly
       acidic. Most stable at pH 4-5. /Iodide/
