   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Vapor pressure for phthalate esters are extremely low, contributing
       much to their thermal stability in plastics. /Phthalate esters/
     * 0.14% (by wt) of water in the phthalate
     * Most phthalate esters have a relatively high calculated log
       octanol/water partition coefficient > 2.12 indicating that they are
       lipophilic. /Phthalate esters/
     * ... Resistance to migration from polymers, low temperature
       flexibility ... compatibility with polar polymers and additives
       over a wide range of compositions. /Phthalate esters/
     * Phthalate esters are soluble to various extents in many common
       organic solvents and oils, but have a relatively low solubility in
       water. /Phthalate esters/
     * Phthalate esters would be expected to have UV maxima in the 230 nm
       and 270 nm regions. /Phthalate esters/
     * Henry's Law constant = 3.54X10-6 atm-cu m/mol at 25 deg C (est)
     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 1.78X10-11 cu
       cm/molec-sec at 25 deg C (est)
