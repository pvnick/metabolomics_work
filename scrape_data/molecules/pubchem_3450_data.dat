       high-temperature form of titanium; resistant to acid attack by HF
       and HCl
     * Molar heat capacity: 24.06 J/mol K at 25 deg C, 100 kPa (760 mm Hg)
     * Standard enthalpy of formation (gas): 658.1 kJ/mol
     * Standard enthalpy of fusions: 37.48 kJ/mol
     * Oxidized to trioxide at red heat; slowly oxidized by steam; not
       attacked by water, dilute acids or concn hydrochloric acid; reacts
       with nitric acid, hot concn sulfuric acid, fused potassium chlorate
       or nitrate; attacked by fluorine at ordinary temp, by chlorine or
       bromine at a red heat
     * Vapor pressure: 1.83X10-9 Pa at 1600 K; 4.07X10-7 Pa at 1800 K;
       3.03X10-5 Pa at 2000 K 0.00102 Pa at 2200 K; 0.0189 Pa at 2400 K

     * Atomic number: 42; valences: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; naturally occurring
       isotopes: 98 (23.75%), 96 (16.5%), 92 (15.86%), 95 (15.7%), 100
       (9.62%), 97 (9.45%), 94 (9.12%). Artifical radioactive isotopes:
       88-91; 93; 99; 101-105

     * IT /MOLYBDENUM/ IS NOT EASILY OXIDIZED BY AIR OR WATER @ ORDINARY
       TEMP & HAS POOR OXIDN RESISTANCE @ HIGHER TEMP. WHEN HEATED ABOVE
       400 DEG C IT YIELDS A HIGHLY VOLATILE TRIOXIDE (MOO3) AND ABOVE 700
       DEG C OXIDN BECOMES SO SEVERE THAT ITS USE IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF IT
       IS PROTECTED BY A COVERING LAYER OF AN OXIDN-RESISTANT METAL, AN
       ALLOY OR DEPOSITION OF SILICON.
     * Reacts with nitric acid, hot concn sulfuric acid, fused potassium
       chlorate or nitrate.
