     * Solubility in water is extremely low. ... Soluble in oils and
       organic solvents.
     * ... The accuracy of a method based on capillary gas chromatography
       for estimating vapor pressure of nonpolar compounds was tested by
       comparing vapor pressures measured by gas chromatography with
       literature values for the subcooled liquid. Two 1.0 m long fused
       silica columns were used, a poly(dimethylsiloxane) bonded phase
       column (BP-1) and a WCOT hydrocarbon phase column (Apolane-87). Gas
       chromatography measurements were carried out by using n(no)-C18 and
       n-C20 hydrocarbons as vapor pressure reference compounds. ... The
       gas chromatography method was applied to 30 polychlorinated
       biphenyl isomerids containing 1-7 chlorines. The average vapor
       pressure decreased by a factor of 4.5 for each chlorine added to
       the biphenyl core, although large differences in vapor pressure
       were measured for isomers of a particular chlorination level. ...

     * A generator column technique was used to directly determine log Kow
       (1-octanol/water partition coefficient) values for 15
       polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) cogeners and biphenyl. The method
       circumvented many experimental difficulties encountered with the
       traditional shake-flask system. Log Kow values generated by this
       procedure were compared with data obtained from the shake-flask
       method, 2 chromatographic estimation techniques and the
       computational method of Hansch and Leo. ...
