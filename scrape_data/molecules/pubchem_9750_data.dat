   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * White to light-tan crystalline alkaloid; odorless. MP 270 deg C
       with decomposition. Soluble in water and alcohol; insoluble in
       acetone, chloroform, and ether; aqueous solution is strongly
       dextrorotary (specific rotation for 1% solution of anhydrous -208
       to +218 degrees). /Chloride/
     * Hexagonal and pentagonal microplatelets from water. Can exist in
       the form of various hydrates. The anhydrous materl (dec 274-275 deg
       C) takes up water in moist atm until it reaches the pentahydrate
       stage, dec approximately 270 deg C. Specific optical rotation: +190
       deg @ 22 deg C/D; +219 deg @ 23 deg C/D (c= 0.785 in methanol). UV
       max (H2O): 280 nm (E=118, 1%, 1 cm). /Chloride, d-Form/
     * Solublity (25 deg C): approx 50 mg/l water; but supersaturated
       solustions are formed readily. Solubility also reported as
       approximately 1 g/40 ml water; approximately 1 g/75 ml ethanol.
       Also soluble in methanol. Insoluble in pyridine, chloroform,
       benzene, acetone, ether. /Chloride, d-Form/
     * Needles from water; mp: 268 deg C (effervescence); specific optical
       rotation: -258 deg @ 20 deg C (c=0.38) for the anhydrous salt
       /Chloride, l-Form/
     * Crystals, dec about 236 deg C (effervescence); specific optical
       rotation: +185 deg @ 25 deg C/D ; to +195 deg C (c=0.5 in H2O), UV
       max (acidified 0.005% aq soln): 280 nm (A= ~89, 1%, 1 cm). Soluble
       in water, dil sodium hydroxide, Sparingly sol in alcohol, in dil
       HCl, chlorform. Practically insoluble in benzene, ether. /Dimethyl
       ether/
     * ODORLESS, WHITE, YELLOWISH WHITE TO GRAYISH WHITE CRYSTALLINE
       POWDER /CHLORIDE/
     * ODORLESS, WHITE OR PALE YELLOW CRYSTALLINE POWDER /DIMETHYL IODIDE/
     * INSOL IN DIETHYL ETHER /CHLORIDE/
     * CRYSTALS; MAX ABSORPTION: 280 NM (E= 74, 1%, 1CM); SOL IN WATER
       APPROX 300 MG/100 ML; SLIGHTLY SOL IN DIL HYDROCHLORIC ACID, DIL
       SODIUM HYDROXIDE; VERY SLIGHTLY SOL IN ALC; PRACTICALLY INSOL IN
       BENZENE, ETHER, CHLOROFORM; SPECIFIC OPTICAL ROTATION: +148 TO +158
       DEG @ 22 DEG C/D (0.25%) /DIMETHYL IODIDE/
     * SPECIFIC OPTICAL ROTATION: +190 DEG @ 22 DEG C/D (0.5%); +219 DEG @
       23 DEG C/D (METHANOL, 0.785%); DECOMP APPROX 270 DEG C
       /PENTAHYDRATE, CHLORIDE/
