   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Only one stable isotope, Iodine-127, is found in nature.
     * Heat capacity (constant pressure): 13.011 cal/mole/deg C (25 deg C)
     * Naturally occuring stable isotope (mass number): 127 (1005); known
       artificial isotopes: 108 to 141; commonly used radioactive tracer
       elements: 123 (half-life 13.27 hours, electron capture decay), 125
       (half-life 59.408 days, electron capture decay), 129 (half-life
       1.57X10+7 years, beta decay), 131 (half-life 8.02070 days, beta(-)
       decay)
     * Dissolves in iodide solutions to form triiodides such as sodium
       triiodide & potassium triiodide.
     * Solvents containing nitrogen atoms, such as pyridine, quinoline, or
       amines, dissolve iodine to form brown solutions while chloroform,
       carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulfide, fluorinated amines and
       especially phosphorous tri-chloride give violet solutions.
     * Solubility in water is increased by alkali bromides and decreased
       by sulfates and nitrates.
     * Heat of fusion: 15.52 kJ/mole
     * Density at 101.3 kPa: 3.96 at 120 deg C (liquid)
     * Iodine is a powerful oxidizing agent.
     * Readily sublimes having a violet vapor ... A semiconductor.
     * Iodine readily forms charged ions (I-) but has the lowest electron
       affinity of the four halogen gases. It also is the most
       electropositive of the halogens and functions in the I+ form in
       some compounds... .
