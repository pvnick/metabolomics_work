   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Lustrous, ductile, malleable metal; Mohs' hardness: 3.0; specific
       resistance: 1.673 microohm/cm; heat of fusion: 48.9 cal/g; heat
       capacity (solid): 0.092 cal/g/deg C at 20 deg C, (liq): 0.112
       cal/g/deg C; becomes dull when exposed to air; two naturally
       occurring isotopes: 63 (69.09%), 65 (30.91%); 9 artificial isotopes
     * Very slowly attacked by cold hydrochloric acid or dil sulfuric
       acid; readily by dil nitric acid, and by both not conch sulfuric
       acid and hydrobromic acid. It is also attacked by acetic acid and
       other organic acids.
     * COPPER FORMS TWO SERIES OF SALTS, CU(1+) AND CU(2+) BOTH VALENCE
       TYPES FORM COMPLEX IONS THAT ARE STABLE.
     * Ductile, excellent conductor of electricity. Complexing agent,
       coordination numbers 2 and 4. More resistant to atmospheric
       corrosion than iron, forming green layer of hydrated basic
       carbonate. Readily attacked by alkalies. Noncombustible, except as
       powder.
     * ELECTRONEGATIVITY (PAULING SCALE): 1.90
     * Dissolved readily in nitric acid and hot concentrated sulfuric
       acids slowly, but only when exposed to the atmosphere.
