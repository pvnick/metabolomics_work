       exposure to air and light; 1 g dissolves in about 3 mL water;
       slightly sol in alcohol. /l-form d-Bitartrate/
     * Sparingly soluble in water, alcohol /dl-Epinephrine/
     * Crystals from alcohol, mp 157 deg C. Readily soluble in water;

       Base, NSRDS-NBS-63). /Adrenaline/
     * Deteriorates rapidly on expsoure to air, light, heat, and alkalies.
       Copper, iron, and zinc destroy its activity. Slowly forms and
       inactive sulfonate in solution with sulfite or bisulfite. The red
       color that forms when neutral or alkaline solutions are exposed to
       air is caused by adrenochrome.
