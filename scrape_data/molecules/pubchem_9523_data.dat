   Solubilities

     * PRACTICALLY INSOL IN WATER, ETHER & CHLOROFORM; 1 G IN 50 ML
       ALCOHOL & ABOUT 4 ML ACETONE; DISSOLVES IN HCL HYDROGEN CHLORIDE OR
       SODIUM HYDROXIDE SOLN THROUGH SALT FORMATION
     * Insoluble in ethyl ether
     * In water, 610 mg/L at 37 deg C
     * The solubility interactions of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in
       binary solvents were studied using hexane (n-hexane)-ethyl acetate,
       ethyl acetate-methyl alcohol (methanol), and methyl alcohol-water
       as the solve mixtures. When solubilities were obtained for
       individual components, trimethoprim exhibited solvation in ethyl
       acetate-methyl alcohol mixtures, while sulfamethoxazole showed
       weaker solute-solvent interactions in the solvent series. At its
       peak, the solubility of sulfamethoxazole was about 8 times higher
       than that of trimethoprim when the drugs were combined.
       Sulfamethoxazole lowered trimethoprim solubility by 13-74%.
       Similarly, trimethoprim suppressed sulfamethoxazole solubility by
       10-94%. In water, although mutual solubility was reduced, the
       solubility ratio of trimethoprim to sulfamethoxazole was 1:4 on the
       mol fraction scale.
