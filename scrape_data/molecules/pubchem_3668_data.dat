   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Monoclinic plates in rosette-like clusters. Slight thiazole odor;
       bitter taste; decomposes at 248 deg C. One gram dissolves in
       approximately 1 mL water, 18 mL glycerol, 100 mL 95% alcohol, 315
       mL absolute alcohol; more soluble in methanol. Soluble in propylene
       glycol. Practically insoluble in ether, benzene, hexane,
       chloroform. pH of 1% wt/vol solution in water 3.13; pH of 0.1%
       wt/vol solution in water 3.58. On exposure to air of average
       humidity, the vitamin absorbs an amount of water corresponding to
       nearly one mole, forming a hydrate.
     * HYGROSCOPIC; NUT-LIKE ODOR /HYDROCHLORIDE/
     * WHEN EXPOSED TO AIR, ANHYD PRODUCT RAPIDLY ABSORBS ABOUT 4% OF
       WATER; SOLN ARE ACID TO LITMUS PAPER; PH (1 IN 100 SOLN) BETWEEN
       2.7 & 3.4; ACIDIC SOLN HAVE PH BELOW 5.5; ALKALIES DESTROY IT
       /HYDROCHLORIDE/
     * MAX ABSORPTION (WATER, PH 8): 235 NM (LOG E= 4.1); 268 NM (LOG E=
       3.9); SADTLER REF NUMBER: 324 (IR, PRISM); 123 (UV) /HYDROCHLORIDE/
     * READILY SPLIT BY SULFITE INTO ITS PYRIMIDINE & THIAZOLE
       CONSTITUENTS
     * Crystals. MP: 196-200 deg C, decomposes; practically
       nonhygroscopic; pKa = 4.9. Solubility in water (g/100 mL): 2.7 (25
       deg C); approximately 30 (100 deg C). pH of 2% aqueous solution 6.5
       to 7.1, more stable than the hydrochloride; suitable for enrichment
       of flours and feeds, multivitamin preparations /Mononitrate/
     * MP: 248 DEG C, DECOMP /HYDROCHLORIDE/
     * SMALL WHITE CRYSTALS OR CRYSTALLINE POWDER /HYDROCHLORIDE/
     * SLIGHTLY SOL IN ALC & CHLOROFORM /MONONITRATE/
     * MONONITRATE IS MUCH LESS SOL IN WATER THAN HYDROCHLORIDE
     * Thiamine hydrochloride in the dry state is stable. Acidic solutions
       having a pH below 5.5 preferably from 5.0 to 3.5 are also
       relatively stable. Alkalies destroy it. It is precipitated from
       solution by several of the alkaloidal reagents such as mercuric
       chloride, iodine, picric acid, tannin, and Mayer's reagent. It is
       sensitive to both oxidizing and reducing agents. /Hydrochloride/
     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 1.98X10-11 cu
       cm/molec-sec at 25 deg C (est)
