   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Poor reflector of UV
     * Pure silver has highest electrical & thermal conductivity and
       lowest contact resistance of all metals.
     * MOLTEN METAL DISSOLVES 20 TIMES ITS VOL OF OXYGEN UNDER 1 ATM &
       GIVES IT UP ON SOLIDIFICATION.
     * Soft, ductile, malleable, lustrous white metal.
     * Silver has the oxidation states +1, and less frequently +2; higher
       ones are rare.
