   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Glistening plates from methanol; mp: 148-149; specific optical
       rotation: +22 deg @ 25 deg C/D (2.3% in methanol) /Cycloheximide
       acetate/
     * Elemental composition: C: 64.04%; H: 8.24%; N: 4.98%; O: 22.75%
     * /Cycloheximide/ activity is destroyed by boiling in aqueous soln at
       pH 7 for 1 hr, but shows no loss of activity after 15 min boiling.
       At pH 2 /cycloheximide/ activity is not degraded by boiling for 1
       hr.
     * IT HAS INTERESTING PROPERTY OF FORMING STABLE DERIV SUCH AS THE
       ACETATE, OXIME, & SEMICARBAZONE THAT ARE ACTIVE AS FUNGICIDES.
