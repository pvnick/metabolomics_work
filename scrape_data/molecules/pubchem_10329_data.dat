     * Solubility Product: 3.36X10-9
     * Melting point: 825 deg C (decomposes) /Aragonite/
     * Aragonite is metastable and irreversibly changes to calcite when
       heated in dry air to about 400 deg C. Vaterite is metastable to
       calcite and aragonite under geological conditions but is found
       during high temperature precipitation of calcium carbonate.
     * Incompatibilities: acids, alum, ammonium salts.
