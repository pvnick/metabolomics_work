   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * VP: 0.3 mm Hg at 200 deg C. Bulk density: 8.05 lb/gal
     * Vapor pressure for phthalate esters are extremely low, contributing
       much to their thermal stability in plastics. /Phthalate esters/
     * Phthalate esters are soluble to various extents in many common
       organic solvents and oils, but have a relatively low solubility in
       water. /Phthalate esters/
     * Most phthalate esters have a relatively high calculated log
       octanol/water partition coefficient > 2.12 indicating that they are
       lipophilic. /Phthalate esters/
     * BP: 261 deg C at 5 mmHg
     * Phthalate esters would be expected to have UV maxima in the 230 nm
       and 270 nm regions. /Phthalate esters/
     * ... Resistance to migration from polymers, low temperature
       flexibility ... compatibility with polar polymers and additives
       over a wide range of compositions. /Phthalate esters/
     * Henry's Law constant = 2.81X10-5 cu cm/molec-sec at 25 deg C (est)
     * Hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant = 2.62X10-11 cu
       cm/molec-sec at 25 deg C (est)
