   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Very pure tungsten can be cut with hacksaw and forged, spun, drawn,
       and extruded; impure metal brittle, worked with difficulty
     * NOT AFFECTED BY SULFUR OR PHOSPHORUS; GOOD ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY
     * VIGOROUS REACTION WITH BROMINE TRIFLUORIDE, CHLORINE TRIFLUORIDE;
       REACTION WITH FLUORINE MAY BE INCANDESCENT
     * Corroded by sea water.
     * Atomic number: 74; valences 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. Naturally occurring
       isotopes: 180 (0.135%); 182 (26.4%); 183 (14.4%); 184 (30.6%); 186
       (28.4%).
     * Hardness: 6.5-7.5. Specific heat (20 deg C): 0.032 cal/g/deg C;
       heat of fusion: 44 cal/g; electrical resistivity (20 deg C) 5.5
       uohm-cm.
     * Forms trioxide at red heat; not attacked by water; oxidized to
       dioxide by steam; very stable to acids, attacked only superficially
       by concn nitric acid or aqua regia; attacked by fluorine at room
       temp; by chlorine at 250-300 deg C giving hexachloride in absence
       of air and trioxide and oxychloride in presence of air.
     * Powdered tungsten can be pyropohric under the right conditions.
       Slowly sol in fused potassium hydroxide in air, in fused sodium
       carbonate in air, and sol in fused mixture of sodium hydroxide and
       nitrate.
