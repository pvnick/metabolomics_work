   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Standard enthalpy of formation (gas): 427.7 kJ/mol; heat capacity:
       24.8 J/mol K (crystal); 23.0 J/ mol K (gas)
     * Heat of Fusion: 16.06 kJ/mol
     * Transformation temperature: 417 deg C; heat of transformation: 251
       J/g; specific heat: 0.442 J/g deg C (15-100 deg C), 0.560 J/g deg C
       (molten metal); coefficient of thermal expansion hexagonal close
       packed at room temperature: 12.5 1/deg C, coefficient of thermal
       expansion face centered cubic at 417 deg C: 14.2 1/deg C; thermal
       conductivity at room temperature: 69.16 W/m K; resistivity:
       6.24X10-8 Ohm-m at 20 deg C; tensile strength of 99.9% cobalt: 237
       MPa (cast); 588 MPa (annealed); 679 MPa (sintered)
     * Magnetic up to 1123 deg C
     * Atomic number 27; valences: 1, 2, 3; rarely 4, 5; latent heat of
       vaporization: 1500 cal/g; very slowly attacked by hydrochloric or
       cold sulfuric acids; hydrated salts of cobalt are red and the
       soluble salts form red solutions, which become blue on adding
       concentrated HCl.
     * Corrodes readily in air; Brinell hardness: 124 (cast); 300
       (electrodeposited)
     * Tends to exist as mixt of two allotropes over wide temp range; beta
       form predominates below 400 deg C; alpha above that temp
     * Chill value of cobalt (100% pure): +1.40
     * Electrical conductivity: 27.6% IACS
     * The presence of cobalt in iron alloys results in substantial incr
       in magnetic retentivity.
     * Slowly attacked by ammonium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide.
     * Close packed hexagonal at room temperature /alpha/
