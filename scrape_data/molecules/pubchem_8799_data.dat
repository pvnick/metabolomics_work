     * Freely sol in water, sol in methanol, ethanol. Insol in ether,
       hydrocarbons. /Hydrochloride/
     * Crystals from butanol + HCl, dec 214 deg C. Specific rotation:
       -257.9 deg at 25 deg C/D (0.5 in 0.1 N HCl). pH (2% aq soln):
       2.1-2.3. /Hydrochloride/
     * Melting point: 175-177 deg C /Tetracycline dihydrate/
     * Tetracycline dihydrate is light-sensitive and hygroscopic.
       /Tetracycline dihydrate/
     * Numerous tetracyclines have been studied in
       stereostructure-activity relationships. The natural
       alpha-orientation of the C-4 dimethylamino group is essential for
       bioactivity. The natural tetracycline configuration at C-5a is
       alpha; its epimer is less than 2% as active. Hydrofluoric
       acid-catalyzed inversion of configuration at C-6 of an inactive
       natural isomer, eg, 5a, 11a- dehydrochlorotetracycline, yields the
       C-6 epimer which is 1.5 times as potent in vitro as tetracycline. 6
       alpha-Fluorine analogs also showed enhanced potency over
       beta-epimers in vitro.
     * Elemental analysis: About 45% C; 6-8% P; 4.8% N; 3.9% H; 0.7-1.4%
