   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * Slightly deliquescent in moist air; on long exposure to air becomes
       yellow due to liberation of iodine, small amount of iodate may be
       formed; light and moisture accelerate the decomposition; aqueous
       solution becomes yellow in time due to oxidation, but a small
       amount of alkali prevents it
     * 30 g KI with 21 mL water gives 30 mL of a saturated solution at 25
       deg C
     * Slightly hygroscopic in moist air
     * Readily dissolves elemental iodine /Potassium iodide solution/
