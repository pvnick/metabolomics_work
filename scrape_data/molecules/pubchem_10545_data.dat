   Solubilities

     * DISSOLVES IN 20 PARTS OF WATER
     * Insol in alcohol or dil alcohol, org solvents
     * Almost completely soluble in 20 parts water; dissolves more readily
       in water, if first moistened with alcohol, glycerol or sugar syrup,
       or if first mixed with 3 or more pars of sucrose

   from [5]HSDB

   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * IN WATER RESULTING COLLOIDAL SOLN IS VISCOUS & OPALESCENT & ACIDIC
     * In water, viscous soln formed contains negatively charged, very
       much hydrated particles
     * Stable under mildly acidic conditions; more strongly acidic or
       basic conditions cause depolymerization
