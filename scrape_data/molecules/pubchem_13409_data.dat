   Other Chemical/Physical Properties

     * The carbohydrate C-4 epimer of adriamycin, epirubicin is as potent
       as its parent molecule, but significantly less toxic.
     * Red-orange crystals, Melting point: 185 deg C (decomposes)
       /Hydrochloride/
     * ... /A study was conducted on/ degradation kinetics of doxorubicin,
       daunorubicin and epirubicin in aqueous solution under fluorescent
       light and sunlight were studied using high performance liquid
       chromatographic methods. The rates of photodegradation of the 3
       drugs were similar; they were inversely proportional to the drug
       concentration and were accelerated by an increase in pH of the
       vehicle. Photodegradation followed first order kinetics. At
       concentrations greater than or equal to 500 ug/ml no special
       precautions appeared to be necessary to protect freshly prepared
       solutions of these agents from light. Photolysis was very rapid,
       however, at concentrations in the low microgram range; therefore,
       when these solutions are used for in vitro work or stability
       studies, they should be protected from light at all times. In
       addition, adsorptive losses, which may also be pronounced in low
       concentration solutions, should be prevented by storage in
       polypropylene containers.
