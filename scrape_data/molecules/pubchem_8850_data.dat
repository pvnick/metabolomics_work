       -216 DEG (100 MG IN 10 ML 0.1 NORMAL HYDROCHLORIC ACID); PALE
       YELLOW TO TAN CRYSTALLINE POWDER /OXYTETRACYCLINE DIHYDRATE/
     * DECOMP, MONITORED BY HPLC & UV SPECTRAL METHODS, FOLLOWED 1ST ORDER
       KINETICS @ ANY GIVEN PH.
     * Dull yellow, crystalline powder; odorless; slightly bitter
       /Oxytetracycline dihydrate/
     * YELLOW CRYSTALLINE POWDER, ODORLESS, BITTER. /OXYTETRACYCLINE
       HYDROCHLORIDE/
     * Oxytetracycline crystals show no loss in potency on heating for 4
       days at 100 deg, the hydrochloride crystals show less than 5%
       inactivation after 4 months at 56 deg. Aqueous solutions of the
       hydrochloride at pH 1.0 to 2.5 are stable for at least 30 days at
       25 deg. Solutions at pH 3.0 to 9.0 show no detectable loss in
       potency on storage at 5 deg for at least 30 days. Half-life in
       hours of aqueous oxytetracycline solutions at 37 deg: pH 1.0 = 114,
       pH 2.5 = 134, pH 4.96 = 45, pH 5.5 = 45, pH 7.0 = 26, pH 8.5 = 33,
       pH 10.0 = 14
     * Yellow platelets from water. Very soluble in water (1 g/ml).
       Concentrated aqueous solutions at neutral pH hydrolyze on standing
       and deposit crystals of oxytetracycline. Solubility in absolute
       ethanol: 12,000 ug/ml, in 95% ethanol: 33,000 ug/ml /Hydrochloride/
     * Dull-yellow crystalline powder; odorless; slightly bitter...soluble
       in acids and alkalies; very slightly soluble in acetone, alcohol,
       chloroform, and water; practically insoluble in ether; stable in
       air; affected by sunlight; deteriorates in solutions with pH less
       than 2; destroyed rapidly by alkali hydroxide solutions; pH
       (saturated solution) 6.115 /Dihydrate/
     * Yellow platelets from water. Very soluble in water (1 g/ml).
